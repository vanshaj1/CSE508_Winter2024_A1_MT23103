these
pedals
are
great
!
!
a
friend
of
mine
said
i
should
buy
other
pedals
because
these
pedals
are
n't
manufactured
by
a
very
known
brand
name
but
i
went
with
my
own
judgement
and
i
was
not
disappointed
with
them
.
i
have
increased
my
speed
a
lot
since
i
've
gotten
em
and
i
can
pedal
songs
like
``
all
nightmare
long
''
and
``
beast
and
the
harlot
''
now
=
]
great
pedals
.
but
,
it
takes
time
to
develop
speed
so
do
n't
think
the
pedals
suck
just
because
you
barely
get
em
and
you
ca
n't
go
all
jason
costa
on
em
