bought
two
of
these
at
the
same
time
and
one
arrived
broken
in
two
spots
.
the
adjustment
screw
was
missing
on
the
base
(
see
photo
)
and
the
one
for
the
top
part
was
stripped
out
.
both
screws
are
made
of
plastic
with
some
kind
of
cheap
pot
metal
fittings
that
likely
do
n't
take
much
force
to
break
.
it
's
a
20
mile
drive
to
the
nearest
ups
store
to
return
these
or
i
have
to
pay
for
pickup
.
it
was
n't
worth
it
for
something
that
costs
$
15
so
i
drilled
a
small
hole
and
tapped
a
small
screw
into
it
.
if
i
had
an
easier
option
to
return
it
,
i
would
and
get
something
else
.
the
one
that
was
n't
broke
on
arrival
works
well
but
i
'm
not
holding
my
breath
it
will
last
long
or
survive
falling
over
more
than
once
.
