i
was
really
looking
forward
to
using
this
keyboard
due
to
it
having
all
of
the
features
that
i
needed
at
it
's
particular
price
point
.
when
i
opened
it
up
,
it
did
n't
even
come
in
it
's
own
box
.
it
's
box
was
just
the
shipping
box
.
immediately
after
taking
it
out
of
the
box
,
i
heard
this
rattle
as
if
something
was
loose
inside
and
it
fell
through
the
entire
keyboard
like
a
rain
stick
.
i
checked
out
all
of
the
keys
individually
and
they
all
worked
except
for
a
c
#
on
the
lowest
octave
.
i
do
n't
know
if
it
was
the
fault
of
nektar
,
audiodeluxe
or
ups
but
i
just
ca
n't
really
recommend
this
keyboard
the
way
i
had
received
it
.
