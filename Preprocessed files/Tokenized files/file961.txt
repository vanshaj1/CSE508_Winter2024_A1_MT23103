i
bought
this
last
week
from
another
retailer
.
this
is
the
best
case
i
have
ever
purchased
,
but
it
's
heavy
as
hell
!
i
was
n't
expecting
it
to
be
150lbs
empty
.
the
table
is
extremely
sturdy
.
folds
out
easy
.
the
table
can
be
reversed
to
either
side
.
casters
are
solid
as
a
rock
,
so
solid
if
you
get
this
thing
past
5mph
and
hit
a
rock
,
this
thing
may
flip
.
try
not
to
keep
it
top
heavy
.
only
con
i
can
think
is
,
it
's
a
pain
to
flip
back
up
if
you
lay
it
down
.
i
laid
it
down
to
install
equipment
,
i
could
n't
pick
it
back
up
no
matter
what
i
tried
.
you
're
gon
na
love
this
thing
