i
previously
purchased
the
20
'
cable
for
my
sg
and
marshall
amp
,
and
i
was
very
satisfied
.
i
have
a
couple
of
pedals
with
different
variations
that
i
wanted
to
incorporate
,
and
the
old
saying
``
if
it
ai
n't
broke
,
do
n't
fix
it
''
came
to
mind
.
so
i
ordered
2
of
the
6
'
cables
to
complete
my
personal
set
up
.
you
ca
n't
go
wrong
with
these
.
great
cords
!
