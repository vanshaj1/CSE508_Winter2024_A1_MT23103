perfect
fit
on
my
2016
gibson
les
paul
studio
faded
.
i
did
n't
like
the
original
speed
knobs
because
they
were
too
big
and
clunky-feeling
.
i
was
skeptical
about
these
knobs
after
reading
some
reviews
about
poor
quality
,
but
i
think
they
're
very
high
quality
.
the
finish
is
perfect
on
them
:
no
seams
,
scratches
,
chips
,
etc
.
i
do
n't
know
what
more
someone
could
expect
quality-wise
.
they
also
sit
much
closer
to
the
body
than
the
old
speed
knobs
,
so
it
's
a
cleaner
look
.
i
truly
ca
n't
imagine
why
anyone
would
have
any
problem
with
these
whatsoever
if
they
're
ordering
for
a
usa-made
gibson
.
i
do
n't
think
these
will
fit
so
well
on
an
epiphone
though
.
