for
the
price
,
it
ca
n't
be
beat
.
i
had
n't
picked
up
a
fiddle
in
50
years
,
so
i
did
n't
want
to
invest
a
lot
of
money
in
something
i
would
n't
use
,
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
instrument
.
of
course
it
's
not
a
high
dollar
violin
,
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
.
edit
(
after
five
weeks
)
:
i
just
changed
the
strings
and
there
is
good
and
bad
.
first
,
the
bad
:
the
holes
for
the
strings
in
the
tuning
pegs
had
to
have
been
drilled
by
a
nearsighted
drunkard
.
they
were
all
way
off-center
and
most
likely
weaken
the
pegs
.
now
for
the
good
:
i
replaced
the
original
strings
with
d'addario
pro
arte
strings
and
it
made
a
world
of
difference
.
it
now
sounds
just
as
a
violin
should
and
is
much
more
enjoyable
to
play
.
