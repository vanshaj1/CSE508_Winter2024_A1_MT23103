this
tailpiece
is
very
solid
and
the
plating
and
finish
could
n't
be
better
.
so
great
for
the
price
.
i
do
n't
expect
plating
will
stand
contact/rubbing
for
long
,
but
that
's
the
case
with
most
gold
plated
hardware
,
so
i
suggest
any
gold
hardware
be
handled
delicately
.
i
know
gold
plating
costs
so
much
more
than
its
price
,
so
it
's
a
bargain
.
