really
.
with
this
,
there
is
no
need
for
a
pedaltrain
pedal
board
.
the
build
quality
is
the
same
and
you
can
buy
different
sizes
.
the
only
con
i
can
think
of
is
that
they
do
n't
provide
a
small
strip
of
velcro
for
the
bottom
part
of
the
board
...
yet
they
provide
velcro
,
most
other
boards
do
n't
.
