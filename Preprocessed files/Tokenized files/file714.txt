i
bought
this
for
my
monoprice
les
paul
copy
,
as
it
does
n't
come
with
a
pickup
selector
plate
or
pickguard
.
i
'm
happy
with
the
color
and
quality
,
it
came
with
a
bunch
of
screws
and
a
pick
.
i
did
n't
need
the
backplates
,
but
they
are
the
right
size
.
for
the
price
i
'm
happy
,
as
the
pickguard
alone
can
run
anywhere
from
$
10-20
.
