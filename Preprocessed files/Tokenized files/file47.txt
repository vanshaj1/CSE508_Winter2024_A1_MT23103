a
little
higher
up
than
i
thought
it
would
be
,
but
nice
that
i
got
my
pedal
board
running
a
little
under
my
amp
,
now
i
do
n't
kick
my
amp
when
i
go
to
switch
effects
.
wish
there
was
more
adjustability
but
it
is
what
it
is
,
one
of
the
more
affordable
stands
ca
n't
be
asking
too
much
.
the
back
power
plug
socket
on
my
amp
(
bugera
v5
)
barely
interferes
with
the
back
bar
of
the
stand
(
bottom
of
the
plug
hitting
top
of
the
bar
)
but
i
got
the
weight
of
the
amp
slightly
resting
on
it
and
i
do
n't
think
it
's
severe
enough
that
it
's
a
danger
.
stand
wo
n't
be
moved
around
much
so
i
expect
it
to
last
for
a
long
long
time
.
