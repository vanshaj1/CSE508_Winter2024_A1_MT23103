this
box
does
everything
i
need
it
to
.
it
's
passive
,
so
it
does
n't
color
the
sound
,
it
makes
for
easy
switching
between
my
two
sets
of
monitors
,
and
even
has
an
auxiliary
input
(
rca
connection
)
with
separate
volume
control
(
which
i
use
to
patch
in
an
xbox
.
got
ta
take
5
from
working
every
once
in
a
while
!
)
.
the
main
volume
knob
is
really
smooth
and
has
some
slight
resistance
,
which
makes
it
feel
great
when
dialing
in
levels
.
i
chose
to
mount
it
under
my
desk
with
the
included
brackets
(
mounted
upside-down
so
the
box
is
hanging
)
so
that
it
's
right
at
arm
height
for
extremely
quick
access
.
people
have
said
the
headphone
amp
is
n't
great
,
but
i
've
never
used
it
as
i
connect
my
headphones
directly
to
my
interface
when
needed
,
so
i
ca
n't
comment
on
that
claim
.
i
do
n't
tend
to
throw
money
around
for
the
studio
all
``
willy
nilly
''
,
but
i
'm
sure
glad
i
purchased
this
unit
.
for
something
that
really
does
n't
do
much
,
it
's
definitely
a
unit
that
make
working
a
lot
more
enjoyable
.
