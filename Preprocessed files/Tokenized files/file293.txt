does
everything
i
need
it
to
do
,
gets
the
instrument
out
of
the
way
,
on
but
not
against
the
wall
and
in
a
good
place
to
be
seen
.
this
works
even
if
you
do
n't
have
a
stud
where
you
want
to
put
it
,
i
just
nail
it
to
the
wall
,
the
white
plastic
things
they
included
looked
like
they
might
make
some
big
holes
.
it
also
looks
good
when
the
instrument
is
n't
hanging
on
it
.
i
have
3
now
,
they
take
about
4
or
5
days
to
arrive
.
