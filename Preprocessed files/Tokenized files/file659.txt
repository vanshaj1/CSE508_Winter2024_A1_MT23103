well
...
i
guess
the
truth
is
this
product
is
not
for
everyone
.
quality
does
not
compare
with
a
regular
amp
.
you
need
to
purchase
apps
to
be
able
to
get
anything
out
of
it
.
i
guess
its
for
people
who
are
mobile
and
do
n't
want
or
cant
take
their
amp
with
them
?
since
i
play
at
home
,
i
would
n't
change
using
my
fender
amp
to
use
this
on
an
ipad
or
iphone
ever
.
i
am
returning
the
product
now
,
but
if
you
fit
the
mobile
type
,
you
should
get
it
.
best
option
out
there
