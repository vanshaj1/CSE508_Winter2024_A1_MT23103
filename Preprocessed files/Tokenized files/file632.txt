i
bought
these
for
my
office
.
i
wanted
to
put
a
barrier
between
the
speaker
phone
and
the
wall
to
help
reduce
echo
and
keep
my
nosy
neighbor
from
listening
in
.
i
ca
n't
tell
if
you
if
it
works
for
the
neighbor
but
the
echo
is
gone
now
.
i
also
have
my
computer
speakers
near
them
as
well
and
that
seems
to
shield
a
little
noise
too
.
these
had
trouble
sticking
on
my
wall
at
first
,
i
ended
up
using
industrial
velcro
,
it
just
would
n't
hold
with
anything
else
.
i
'm
pretty
happy
with
them
and
they
do
n't
look
that
bad
either
.
