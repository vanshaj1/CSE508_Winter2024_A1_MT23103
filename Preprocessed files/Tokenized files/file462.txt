its
a
bit
taller
than
i
needed
,
in
the
neck
area
,
but
its
not
an
issue
once
you
fill
the
pockets
.
i
put
my
music
stand
in
the
pocket
by
the
neck
.
i
took
off
one
star
because
the
bigger
pockets
are
n't
quite
big
enough
to
hold
my
fast
track
instruction
books
,
which
are
n't
much
bigger
than
the
book
currently
in
the
pocket
,
but
i
just
put
them
behind
my
guitar
.
