this
pickguard
is
wonderful
,
did
n't
have
to
mod
it
in
any
way
,
and
i
was
concerned
because
the
old
one
on
the
guitar
is
bigger
then
this
one
.
thought
i
would
have
some
visible
holes
on
the
guitar
but
nope
it
fit
like
a
glove
.
now
i
have
a
great
looking
guitar
,
oh
let
's
do
n't
forget
the
price
.
very
low
price
,
awesome
product
came
with
screws
most
do
n't
so
why
buy
a
name
brand
at
5
times
the
cost
.
