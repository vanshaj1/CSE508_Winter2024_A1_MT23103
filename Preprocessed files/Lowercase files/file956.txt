fits 8 chauvet slimpar 64 rgba, power cords, dmx board and paperwork in front pouch and misc. supplies in end pouches and nothing is tight. this bag is made very well and has heavy duty zippers. it has 10 dividers that velcro in and can be moved. the bottom velcros in too for nice padding. at first the bag seemed short inside so i removed the bottom and placed it in properly to get the right height. it also has a nice shoulder strap. finally a great product. i am now a phitz fan!
