actually surprised. i originally intended to use this as a low gain type pedal but when i unintentionally cascades this into my rat 2 pedal, a magical thing happened. this guy opened up the mids in the rat pedal. i am running the rat at 18volts with excellent results. this drive pedal is set at gain 2 and cascading into the rat pedal. excellent! immediately earning a prized spot on my board.
