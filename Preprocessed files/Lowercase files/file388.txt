i have always hated tuners; i would rather use tuning fork on the a string and go from there. most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power(pedals). in addition i couldn't use those on my acoustics. snark solves all of these problems. the display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock. there is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo. i can easily move it from electric to acoutic, and amazon's pricing is so low i am considering getting one for each of my guitars. this is one of the few 5 star ratings i've given any product on amazon and i rate a lot.
