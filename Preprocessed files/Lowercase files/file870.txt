specs
- dynamic, cardiod polar pattern (it's pick up is highest on the top of the mic, a bit less on the sides, and doesn't pick up from the bottom of course (i attached a picture from the manual)
- 300ohm
- weighs 9oz
- 3pin xlrm
- 90-16,000hz frequency response (pretty flat too)

durability & price
- this is a workhorse mic with rare earth magnets and all metal construction.  it's built rugged and has some good sound isolation so that movement of the mic isn't picked up as much
- it's not their top of the line mic so not the most expensive but for the vast majority of needs out there for a cardiod mic, this should work nicely
- i think it can take a beating and keep performing.  it looks nice, traditional and robust
