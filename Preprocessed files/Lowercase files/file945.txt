it works! this is a nice product i'm happy, however there are some things i noticed but nothing to take much away from the pedal, especially considering the low price.

pros:

(out of 5 ratings)

*great price: 5/5
*sturdy build: 5/5
*tunes accurately: 5/5 (i used this along with a reliable tuner app and they were both tuning simultaneously)
*size and looks 5/5

cons: (some people may consider these as cons)

(out of 5 rating)

*tuning speed: 3/5 (you have to hit the string once to it for fastest: repeatedly hitting the string takes longer)
*power source: 4/5 (doesn't take battery, but any 9v adapter will work)

overall product rating: 4/5
