i was able to install my new guitar hanger easily. i found a stud exactly where i wanted to install it, and i predrilled the holes to accommodate the two long wood screws; drywall anchors are included in the package.

the metal bracket is sturdy, and the wooden plate is held in place with a key-like spacer sleeved around the hanger bolt.

i am impressed with the results. i highly recommend this guitar hanger for anyone whose guitar is taking up room on the floor.
