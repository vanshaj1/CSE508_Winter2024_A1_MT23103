i've been using this little amp for over a month now and totally love it.  i run it into a small cabinet with a jensen vintage c8r4 8-inch ceramic speaker housed in a maple 12" x 12" cabinet and it sounds amazing.  if you closed your eyes you would think you were hearing a fender tweed combo from the 50's.  i use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it's as sweet as the larger setups i have in my main music room.  i use this in my office and it's perfect for the space.  i can't believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  if you're looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other hotone amps like the legacy british invasion or purple wind.
