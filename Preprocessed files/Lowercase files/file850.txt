this is great sounding at a great price! is it perfect? no, but it is no less perfect than something costing a lot more and not sounding as good as this pedal. i read one review in which the guy was not satisfied because he said it sounded like "80's glam rock." i totally disagree. if you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. it seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound. i prefer a thicker creamy sound and you can dial that up with this pedal. for a mere $35, i was willing to roll the dice - i found a diamond in the rough.
