great pups!

fender really got these right!
great vintage tone pups at a steal.
replaced original lace pup equipped pickguard in my strat plus. and wired up a new pickguard with a .022 cap. which is working fine for me.

if you also need pickup adjustment screws and you have a modern pick guard. be aware these come with oval head countersunk pickup adjustment screws for vintage pickguards.
