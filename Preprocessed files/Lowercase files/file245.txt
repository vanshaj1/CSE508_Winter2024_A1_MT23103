all i have to do is install this on my strat. instructions gave me a good idea of what needs to be done, and i have experience with all kinds of stuff since i was involved with all types of proto-typing in many different machine shops so it should be a fun project.

edit: installed the fender lsr roller nut. i didn't time myself but couldn't have taken more than 1 hour. playing this guitar is much better now even though the e and e strings are close to the edge of the fretboard. i have less problem placing my fingers cause the strings seem to have a wider spread, i didn't measure this, it's all feel. absolutely made a positive difference, stays in tune much better than before and the tremolo is adjusted to the floating position.
