this is the worst fitting junk i have ever seen! the pickgaurd is to big and the back plates are to small and the holes do not line up. i could make the pick guard work but it would take time with a drimel to make sure it fit properly without any gaps. the back plates are almost a full 1/4 inch off. waste of time and money.
