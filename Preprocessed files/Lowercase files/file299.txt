it takes awhile to get used to using leather instead of the usual fabric strap. fabric strap can be shifted freely on my shoulder however leather one has lots of friction and it has thicker width. i need to lift up the strap to adjust its position on my shoulder. this is made of synthetic
leather. plasticry smell and feel, not genuine leather type feel. good strap if you want thicker width to relieve shoulder pain
