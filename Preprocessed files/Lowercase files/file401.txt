a slick pick holder with a small footprint. it sticks with suction -- just press down and it adheres. it pops on and off without damaging the guitar finish so it can be switched between guitars and placed wherever most advantageous for the player. it disengages with ease for storage and/or transport. i switched out a thinner pick in place of the one included and the device gripped it tightly. ingenious gadget and modestly priced.
