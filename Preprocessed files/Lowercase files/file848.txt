imo this is the best and only way to mount toms, especially pearls.  my session kit came with them and with the heavy 6 play maple toms have never had a single issue with tuning, bouncing, lug stress whatsoever.  i think after you use them for a while you can take them for granted and don't fully understand how sturdy they are until you use another suspension system.  i recently purchased a pearl birch vision kit for my wife which came with pearl's i.s.s. mounting system.  to be fair i've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the optimounts went right on.  even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) masterworks version, i feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.  most drummers buy, skin, and play for sound, but showing off your nice wood shells never hurts.  i can't think of a single negative, except that they're not free.  :)
