i bought 4 to use for my pedal board that i just made. upon opening the first one, it was not one continuous piece. it was cut towards one end and as i unrolled it, a shower of the black mushroom nubs came falling out (see picture). hmm...maybe just a bad roll. i opened the second one. this one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. ok, lets test it out. i attached it to itself and pressed it together. nice grip. then i pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. if i'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, i don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time i move a pedal. i'm sure it would work fine, if you don't move things around, but just the idea that i can't do it do often doesn't sit well. oh well, expensive lesson learned. get the 3m instead. i have used it in the past. good stuff.
