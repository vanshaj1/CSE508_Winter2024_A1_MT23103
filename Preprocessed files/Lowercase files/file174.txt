if you're looking for a gig bag for a semi-hollow guitar or bass, this will do the job. make sure you are looking for part number 0991622206 - that's the metro gig bag for semi hollow basses.

i have a fender modern player starcaster bass, which is a short-scale semi-hollow bass. it's both shorter and wider than the typical fender precision or jazz bass and as a result, did not fit any bag or case i already had. i did some research and it turns out that on fender's website, they specifically state that this gig bag is for semi-hollow basses. i can confirm that my starcaster fits perfectly, and as an added bonus, my gretsch g5120 guitar also fits quite nicely.

the padding on the bag is good. i would definitely say it is about average for a gig bag.  the padding about an inch thick and is better than the really cheap gig bags. however, it is not as good as a $150+ gator gig bag.  i wouldn't check this on a plane, but it would be fine for driving around in your car or just carrying the bass around.
