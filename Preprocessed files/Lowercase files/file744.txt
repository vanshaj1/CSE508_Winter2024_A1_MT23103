another update. how can you sell these to people! i have a craft show this weekend and i went to put these tumers on and none id the screws fit! first one i didn't realize and it got stuck. i had to use two pliers to pull it off and scratched mlthe new neck i just finished making. your company shpuld not be selling these! i now hqve to run out and find somewhere to but 6 sets ....update....i ordered more, they came in odd. the top is too wide that the nuts don't fit!
old review...i love the look of these and they came fast. i bought them for a cbgs ukulele. i wouldn't recommend putting them on a nice guitar. they skip a little.
