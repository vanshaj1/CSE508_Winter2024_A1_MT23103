i purchased these for my oldest son. he plays multiple instruments and had talked about wanting some thumbpicks for his acoustic guitar. i'd much rather purchase items to enhance his musical abilities than video games any day!

first, i had no idea that dunlop was from benicia. i lived in benicia, california for a large portion of my life and when i turned the package over and saw that i was happy and shocked! go benicia! california's first state capital before anyone knew about sacramento!

my son says that these thumbpicks are very comfortable. i tried to get him to let me film a video filming him playing but as usual he is shy.

he loves them.

thank you dunlop.

i paid full price for these dunlop thumbpicks. i wasn't offered any discount or promise of future discounts. i'm offering this review for informational purposes only. thank you!
