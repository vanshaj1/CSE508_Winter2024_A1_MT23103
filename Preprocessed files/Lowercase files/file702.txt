wow what a difference from bare fingers. really nails the tones down with very little effort. very smooth metal and plastic. large fit my mits well. barely opened the middle finger and that was it. been picking for hours and haven't had and movement so far. i'm a 6'3" skinny guy so large hands but skinny fingers. large was perfect. right up to the first knuckle was snug and comfortable. the thumb picks are even better!
