great little pedal. wonderful brand. well built equipment with quality. the housing feels solid and well manufactured. with sound in mind it has a fantastic beautiful depth to it. as a guitarist with roots in rock, grunge and metal it can be a versatile sound with the right mixture. combined with a marshall tube dc40 and it will not leave you unhappy.
