i struggled for a while to find a good ergonomic position to hold my guitar. footrests didn't work well for my practice space and somewhat longer-than-average torso, and i always felt my right leg had to be too far outward. i thought this product was a bit expensive at first for what it is - metal and velcro - but it solved everything for me.
