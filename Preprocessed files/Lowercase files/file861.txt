this tape worked great for my latest build. adhesive is strong and the tape accepted solder well with no issues. it's thin enough to form inside cavities well and installation is easy. i would recommend peeling back just enough backing to start one end and then remove the rest as you go. since the product comes in a pill bottle, it's formed in a tight circle so, if you just hold one end and remove all the backing, it will recoil and stick to itself. great product!
