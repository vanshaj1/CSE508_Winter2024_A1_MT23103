great product and price. i bought these panels for a home studio, mostly for mixing a tracking as i don't do much live recording there. there is definitely a difference and the early reflections from the monitors are lessened (to my ears anyway). they did the job i needed and they look good too! i opted to pin them to the wall with t-pins instead of using adhesive. for my use it works well and i can remove them with little or no damage to the wall. i ordered a second box to put in a pattern on the one remain wall that could use some treatment.

if you are looking for acoustic foam absorption panels, take a look at these.
