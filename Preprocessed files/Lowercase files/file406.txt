the quality of this bass trap is amazing. i record all kinds of music and when mastering a song with heavy bass leads i need to hear it as clearly as possible. this works perfectly. i have trouble hearing someone speaking on the other side of the room. i may have over done it, but the room is so muffed from any sound its almost erie... well worth the money! by the way, when i'm not recording i use this room to play xbox one on. the bass is so crisp and clear. its better then a movie theater!
