i was recommended this particular harmonica by a few players who said "buy the special 20. its a great harmonica and it's perfect for a beginner " so i took their advice and i must say it's fantastic. looks and sounds great and i'm s total newbie but i'm having no trouble at all playing single note songs and exercises. i'll most likely purchase one in every key once i'm more confident and skilled with this one
