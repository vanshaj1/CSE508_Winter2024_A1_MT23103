this board serves the purpose, and if you know what you're doing it is endlessly customizable.  just got it today, but i have bg plans for making it work for me. as a good platform for pedals, it's pretty solid.

one thing i should say: it arrived in pretty rough shape.  the faux cobbled orange leather actually looks pretty bad-ass, but the handles on the top were both bent inwards (the right handle was bent to a 45 degree angle) and loose, and the left handle is beat to crap.  personally, i don't care. that is a ten minute fix. but you might not be happy if you just spent a hundred bucks on it.
