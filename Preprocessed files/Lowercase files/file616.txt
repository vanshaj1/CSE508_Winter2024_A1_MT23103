i own a yamaha 61 keys keyboard and i ordered this stand because the product description says it is yamaha make. but what is written on the box is:'keyboard stand for portable keyboards from yamaha and others' and there is no yamaha emblem neither on the box nor on the stand. in fact, it is just a chinese make generic stand. apart from that, i am happy with the stand. it is:

easy to assemble and fold
sturdy enough to hold a 61 keys keyboard
keyboard fits well
