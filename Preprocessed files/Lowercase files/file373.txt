at last, a neck cradle that makes sense and has some actual thought put into its design. there's a real popular neck cradle that looks like a rabbit and has a nice leather covering. it's rather expensive and i see
them in lots of shops. the problem is that they're  too short for a lot of guitars, especially acoustics. the rocker neck rest from stewmac is ok, but it's completely useless if you need to flip a guitar over on it's face and it'll fall over every time you don't need it to. this cradle is perfect in every way. lots of options for height/angle and the ability to leave the guitar strung and temporarily lock them out of the way onto the lips on this cradle is very, very handy.
