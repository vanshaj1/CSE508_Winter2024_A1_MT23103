oh my word i am sold i love my at2100 which ive used for 5+ years for podcasting and youtube but this thing is amazing for my current use case. im using it as a boom above my head for youtube videos. wow! at about 2-3 feet away it is perfect. very rich sound for my bassy voice. i recommend this to anyone who wants a budget mic with awesome sound.
