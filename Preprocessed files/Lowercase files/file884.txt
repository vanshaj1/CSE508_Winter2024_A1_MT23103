they're pretty decent panels for what it's worth. by far they're not professional grade, but i think they can do well for a small home studio. they are fairly thin, so initially it's going to absorb higher frequencies better than lower frequencies, so keep that in mind.

what i did to hang mine safely without causing damage to the walls: i purchased 12"x12" medium weight chipboard sheets and used 3m spray adhesive to stick the foam to the board. then, i used 1 4lb rated velcro command strip (per each panel) and put it on the wall. it's holding fairly well, and because it's a velcro command strip, you can make slight adjustments as needed.
