tiny little amp. i have never seen these in my retail shops. i just ordered from here. after putting in a 9v battery and plugged in my gretsch guitar, instantly i heard the punching sound of rockabilly. never did i ever heard any strange sounds of feedback or popping or screeching. it was quiet and perfect for me even when i played it real close to the amp. i did not purchase the dc adaptor, just relying on batteries. imagine i could play electric guitar in my car, how portable is this thing! the bad thing about this is that the box packaging looks cheap and printing was bad. the brand name of the amp is located at its back, kind of shy of telling others it's fender. at first i suspected it was fake. however the sound doesn't lie. i realized this amp cost more than the others, not sure if other brands are equally good as well.
