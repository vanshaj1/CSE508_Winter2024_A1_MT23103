i'm a guitar player who sometimes needs to play bass.  my brother bought me for christmas.  i was pleasantly surprised by this guitar's feel and sound when unplugged!  it feels solid and has great sustain unplugged!  it played easy right out of the box though i will eventually get it set up but i'm not in a rush.  with this gift came a fender rumble 25 bass amp that for what i need is perfect and sounds great.  i'm very impressed overall and would recommend this bass to someone looking for a quality instrument without the "quality" price tag.
