i bought two kits for a total of six guitar stand/holders. i don't know why they're described as "acoustic" holders, i'm them using them to hold a heavy fender precision bass, and other standard electric guitars. they're easy to install, but as others have written, do not use the fasteners that come in the kit. they are cheaply made and are unsafe. i simply stopped by walmart and picked up a couple packs of self-drilling drywall anchors (pictured). they're inexpensive fasteners and helped make the installation a breeze. i was able to install all six guitar stands in about 30 minutes.
i highly recommend this product -  as long as you use upgraded fasteners,
