i traded for a tmb100 in sea foam green recently and i was pleased with the construction. the wiring is good. after i set it up everything was great. my only complaint is that i had the bass only 24 hrs before the tone/bass knob snapped off in my hand, right at the base as i was adjusting the tone, rendering them useless and stuck in their current configuration. i didn't really think i was cranking it that hard. now i have to buy a $60 preamp knob before my next show and be terrified that i'm gonna snap it off again. tldr: great guitar. needs a setup. be careful with the specific expensive knobs.
