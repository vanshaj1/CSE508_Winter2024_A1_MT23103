when i first pulled this out of the box i was pleasantly surprised. there were quite a few negative reviews, so i was half expecting  it to arrive in pieces. but it was packaged well and already assembled, so i was pretty happy. once i had it installed on my rack, i noticed the cable holes in the back aren't even punched out! the main reason i bought this was to store my noisy external hard drive.  i can't do that now, so i guess this drawer is just going to hold random crap that i have on my desk.  i'm honestly pretty bummed. i was tempted to give this two stars, but the drawer itself is pretty acceptable for the price. if you don't need to run cables through the back of it,  then i don't see any reason this wouldn't work for you.
