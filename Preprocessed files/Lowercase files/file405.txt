this guitar is far more beautiful in person. the red to gold tones blend so wonderfully and it has a barely visible tiger-stripe/wood pattern effect that i hadn't noticed prior to purchasing it. i got it here for a fraction of the price i was finding it other places. i have had no problems with it whatsoever yet, it plays easily and sounds like i spent a lot more on it than i did. it even arrived sooner than was expected.
