the kit shipped the following day from the distributor after my placing the order, arriving ahead of schedule. it took me a couple of hours to set it up and position the components to my liking. adjusting the sounds, tones and volume of each device was rather straightforward. for the price, i am pleasantly surprised with the action of the cymbals and pads. sounds great when recording as well. i highly recommend this kit for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, but would like a functional, professional-sounding electronic drum set that can take a beating and not take up a whole lot of space. i drum left-handed and placed everything accordingly. high-five to acorn.
