works as advertised (i'm sure along with the other 5 or 6 brands out there that are the exact same one- see pic it's the one they shipped). only thing i'd say is pay attention to your current- everything worked fine except my wireless (line 6). it'd power up but then go dark. turns out it was plugged into a 100ma port. it needs upwards of 300+ma. plugged into the correct port and it was fine. so far no issues after about 6 or 7 gigs. i'm surprised because it's priced so cheap. comes with all the barrel (power) cords (not the 1/4" cords). can't go wrong for under $40.
