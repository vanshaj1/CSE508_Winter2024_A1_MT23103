while i wasn't sure this would fit my 2017 ipad pro 12.9, i was pleasantly surprised. whats impressive is how secure my ipad feels in the grip of the two sets of prongs.

unfortunately, the product will not hold an ipad 12.9 with a book-type case, but it is fine with my silicon shell case. the claws snap onto the ipad perfectly.

i found a way to make the iklip super useful. when detached from my instrument stand, the clamp assembly serves as a highly stable, adjustable kick stand.

mounted on a mic or guitar stand, it is quite adjustable, and a channel in the socket adjustment lets the arm point all the way to the floor.

the clip holds the ipad so snugly that i would trust it in portrait mode even though the clips would be holding your device from the sides.

overall, an excellent product. i just wish that the claws were less shallow so that i could include my book-type case. but since it does accept a thin shell, and its still portable around my house with the kickstand solution, im satisfied.

fyi, last pic is with shell case.
