we needed to upgrade the hot hitz radio mixer. we needed the aux sends to properly work a telos one which places listener phone calls on the air. our old mixer did not have this option so it was time to upgrade. this is a great mixer and the price was really good if you are on a budget. we use this mixer in a studio.
