the way these are shipped all scrunched up may make you nervous, but don't worry. they'll be fine.

one thing to note, per the product description:
"high quality multi color foam for ball shape microphones."

somehow i missed that line before purchasing. these will fit nicely on an sm-58 or other handheld mic with a ball-type grill. they will slide right off an sm-57 or similar shaped mic. that's not a defect, just something you want to know. but at ~$2.00 for a five-pack, i have zero complaints.

and they will work on a straight shaped mic with the aid of a hair-tie, rubber band, gaff tape, etc. for size reference, see pic. i have the blue one on an sm-57. i even managed to get the yellow one to stretch over a sennheiser e609 (this is of questionable usefulness, since it's pretty much exclusively an instrumental mic, but i figured i'd see if i could). they also fit well on my condenser mic (second pic), though they aren't as substantial as the foam cover that came with it.

all in all, would highly recommend these.
