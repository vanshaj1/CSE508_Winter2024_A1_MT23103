sadly, these strings were suggested as replacements for a yamaha guitalele gl-1.
they are not compatible. they are gauged e-e, rather than a-a, and will not fit on the bridge or nut. i am giving it two stars because i can use two of the strings to replace the middle.
overall, i am disappointed that these would be suggested, but i guess im the big dummy that wasn't aware and didn't do my due diligence while trusted the recommendation.
if anyone has replaced all of the stings on their gl-1, please let me know what you used. thank you.
