as i am sure that you know, this is a fulltone ocd clone and let me tell you that it is the closest to a perfect clone in sound as you can get. i love this pedal and because of this one will probably be buying many more joyo products. i wasn't a huge fan of the paint job on the product so i pulled it apart and used ceramic resin engine paint to coat it. i love this pedal and would recommend it to anyone!
