great pickguard!  used on my mim strat project.  purchased a black mim body from amazon and this 3ply black with white border pickguard from musiclily.  guitar looks awesome!  this is a very quality product.  especially for the price.  my guitar body didn't have pickguard holes, so i had to drill them.  i just taped this pickguard down in place and drilled the holes.  i am really happy with the result!
