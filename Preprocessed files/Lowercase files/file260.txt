cable quality is great, as usual from monoprice. however, monoprice used a very sticky tape that left a huge amount of tape-glue on the cable rather than two twist ties or similar..went through 10 minutes and 3 clorox wipes getting it all (mostly) off. unusual for them.
in the photo, the shiny parts on the left and right ate glue residue from the tape. it was thick enough that it coats your fingers when you touch it., and instantly picked up fuzz from everything it touched; not cleaning it was not an option. you'd end up with a fireball every foot of cable.
