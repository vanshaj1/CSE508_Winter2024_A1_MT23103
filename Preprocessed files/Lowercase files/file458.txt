i have nothing bad to say about this stand. it works and it gets the job done. i use it at home,  and i have placed it in a corner of the room with 3 electric guitars, one acoustic, and one bass.

the instructions were just a picture but i got it assembled in less than 10 minutes. really easy to do.

great multi guitar rack/stand for the price. i definitely recommend.
