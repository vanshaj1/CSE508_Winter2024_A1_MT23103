wow! this is a beautiful looking instrument, solidly made, with a nice rich and bright tone, and all for only 38 bucks! worth every penny and more!

addendum: after owning and playing this ukulele for a few months now, i am more and more in love with it. it has a better sound than my other more expensive ukes. i believe this is at least partly due to the larger sound hole. this gives it a brighter, happier, and louder tone. and for this price, you just can't beat this uke!
