a little higher up than i thought it would be, but nice that i got my pedal board running a little under my amp, now i don't kick my amp when i go to switch effects.  wish there was more adjustability but it is what it is, one of the more affordable stands can't be asking too much.  the back power plug socket on my amp (bugera v5) barely interferes with the back bar of the stand (bottom of the plug hitting top of the bar) but i got the weight of the amp slightly resting on it and i don't think it's severe enough that it's a danger.  stand won't be moved around much so  i expect it to last for a long long time.
