remember those little sticky gummi hand things that you used to get out of the quarter machine at the grocery store?&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/sticky-hands-12-per-unit/dp/b0019iaz3y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">sticky hands - 12 per unit</a>

these are kinda like that, but a little thicker and shaped into blue rectangles that are approximately 1" x 2".

you can stick them to any part of your drum head to dampen sound as needed. they even work on cymbals if you're looking for a quicker decay!

the closer to the center (or more pads you use), the more dramatic the effect. you can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed. if you drop them or they end up getting too dirty to stick to anything, you can wash them in the sink with dish soap and air dry them.

i've been using them for years and they work amazingly!
