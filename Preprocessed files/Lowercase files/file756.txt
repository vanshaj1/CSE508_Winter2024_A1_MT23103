installed these humbuckers on my epiphone les paul standard. the sound of the neck and bridge humbuckers are very similar. the bridge just has a tad bit more treble. however, both of these hbs produce a very, very warm sound. when playing with an mxr distortion + it produces a grunge/fuzz sound but keeps clarity of each note. the clarity is outstanding on the hbs-each note can be heard. the hbs are not very versatile, only producing a grunge/fuzz sound, regardless of what distortion pedal i use but it fits my playing style at the moment so i am very happy with them.
