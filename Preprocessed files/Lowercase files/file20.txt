you really cant beat it for the price, however, i would not use it for really heavy lights. its only rated for 50lbs anyway. if you have some led fixtures, a couple lasers (attached picture).... then this is perfect. heavy scanners, and other large format lights (even if only using one ~40 lbs) i would not use. it only feels secure enough for a couple smaller lights and a fogger. just buy it!!! you could always use it in your entertainment center and or, mobile dj rig for some sort of light application.
