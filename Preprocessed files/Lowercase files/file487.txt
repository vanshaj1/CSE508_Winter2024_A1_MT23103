i put this on a yamaha drum rack. the tubes are rather large and this thing opened just wide enough to clamp on. i was really surprised. when i first opened the packed i was thinking i'd have to send it back, but it works perfectly and the clamp is very secure. i submitted a picture of it installed. it doesn't look like it's on all the way, but this thing hasn't moved in almost a year!! i would highly recommend this product!!
