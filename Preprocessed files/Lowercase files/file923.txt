these are heavy and feel pretty sturdy. they fit sturdy and were easy to install. they are darker than in the pics in the product discription. the color is black chrome.

so it's been a few months and these are still on my guitar. i still like them very much. one of the red eyes has fallen off revealing a clear/white rhinestone eye underneath; weird. but hey, whatever. these are still cool, they're still four stars in my eyes and i'm still happy with my purchase.
