it's hard to give less than 5 stars because this light is just an amazing value. it packs a serious punch in terms of output and feels quite sturdy. it has a very thin profile and the housing is a thick rugged plastic. mounting hardware feels smooth and easy to adjust. the display on the back is larger than other lights of this style which is nice when configuring dmx channels. i control mine via a software dmx system, so i can't speak for the built-in modes. it has worked flawlessly in a dmx environment.

i was curious how this light would perform vs. the more expensive 4-in-1 style, and to my surprise the color-mixing is very smooth and has very litle 'rainbow' effect when used as a wash/uplight. i recently played a gig at a winery and used this light for back-lighting the stage. this light is on the rear-left in the attached pictures, with the gbgs 8wx9 on the right.

potential cons: hard-wired power cord, somewhat loud fan ( not noticeable in a live music context )
