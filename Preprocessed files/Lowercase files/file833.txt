i am building a recording studio. every studio i've been to; you always expect a humongous mixer, a mac, very expensive condenser mic, and black mic cables. i wanted something unique and different. the connectors are sold and very nice! cable is thick and sturdy. when i bend the cable i don't feel wires moving around inside. very well made! you will like these cables!
