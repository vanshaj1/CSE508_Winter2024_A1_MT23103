knox gear z heavy duty piano stand is made with quality craftsmanship.

i almost opted for the x stand to save a little.
i'm so glad i took this route; my investment is secure on this z stand.
i was also able to mount my zoom g5n stomp board as well.

the packaging left something to be desired.
a little scuff marks but, i can live with it.
