this is my absolute favorite guitar strap amongst those i've purchased.  i'm using it with an antique german lute guitar (wandervogellaute), and the stained glass pattern complements the carved rosette of the sound hole in a vaguely ecclesiastical motif -- while still looking a little hippie.  the lute guitar is extremely lightweight, so i can't speak to how well the strap would hold up a heavy solid body electric guitar, but it seems to be very sturdily made, and is definitely comfortable.

i was looking to buy another strap for a more conventional guitar and wanted to get something in a different pattern for some variety, but i couldn't find anything i liked half as much as this.  i guess i'll buy another.
