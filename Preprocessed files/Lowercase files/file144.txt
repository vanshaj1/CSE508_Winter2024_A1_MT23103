cool little portable sound amplifier, for when you just got to make noise without waking the neighborhood! very light, hope it's impact resistant so i can stuff it in a back pack with other goodies. i'm using it for harmonica, slide guitar, or as a powered speaker for my media players. the sound is decent and the battery seem to last long enough. i am happy with this purchase. way to go danelectro!
