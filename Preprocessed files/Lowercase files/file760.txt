i'll admit that i bought this power supply to see if i could save about $100 on a better known brand so i wasn't expecting it to work that well and figured it was almost as cheap as my onespot. i've got about 9-10 pedals on my board so i made sure ahead of time that there would be no special needs.

it's worked great, fits underneath my holeyboard's top shelf. it also gives me quiet clean power and no worries. i'm powering pretty standard stuff with the tc electronic's alter ego included. the one thing this power supply did do for me is that i have a t-rex tone bug reverb pedal for my practice amp and it used to be noisy as could be with the onespot but when i switched it over to the donner, it is much quieter.

all in all, it does what it says, works well and looks pretty cool with the blue leds. the actual device is hidden in the picture under the shelf but you can see the led's glow.

very happy with this - i will probably buy another for a hot spare.
