bought these for my peavey raptor plus exp that i'm currently rebuilding. the screw was a bit longer than the one that was for the original string tree, so it took a bit longer and had to use a little bit of elbow grease to fully get it screwed it. but once it was tight, it looks great and matches the rest of the gold hardware on the guitar. i would recommend this to anyone looking to build a partscaster, upgrade the string trees, or do as i'm doing and getting all gold hardware for their guitar.
