i bought this bag for my double kick pedals.  it's a great bag for that purpose.  the pedals fit perfectly, and the fur lining helps protect them .  the exterior pocket is perfect for the beaters, link bar, and any other accessories you need.  i would highly recommend this bag to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport and protect your double pedals.  the only thing i would like to see added to it is a divider between the pedals.
