i bought these for my office. i wanted to put a barrier between the speaker phone and the wall to help reduce echo and keep my nosy neighbor from listening in. i can't tell if you if it works for the neighbor but the echo is gone now. i also have my computer speakers near them as well and that seems to shield a little noise too.

these had trouble sticking on my wall at first, i ended up using industrial velcro, it just wouldn't hold with anything else. i'm pretty happy with them and they don't look that bad either.
