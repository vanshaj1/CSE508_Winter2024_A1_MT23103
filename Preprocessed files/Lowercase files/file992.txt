these were perfect in every way for my application.  i installed these on a mim stratocaster (i had to drill three holes in the tremolo plate to do so) and they were the correct narrow string width ( 2 - 1/16" ) for my application.  i was even able to top-load the strings through the holes where the intonation screws originally fed through, just to piss off the purists.  it worked so well that i am doing the same modification to another of my import strats, but this time with graph tech saddles.  those ones will work as well, but i have to sand off some injection mold flaws first (although that will be easy as well).  i'm a believer in either brass or graphite when it comes to the break-angles of strings and these were literally perfect.
