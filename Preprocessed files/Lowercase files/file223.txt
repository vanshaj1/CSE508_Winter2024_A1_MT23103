love the blue glow of the power supply on my pedal board.  i've only had it for a day so i don't know how it will hold up, but i'm sure it will be fine.  comes with all of the cables to fully power your pedal board.  the a/c adapter cable is only 3 feet long so consider buying an extension chord or power strip to plug it into.
