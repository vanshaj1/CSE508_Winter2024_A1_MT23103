time will tell how it holds up...
i just got it today and i'm impressed!!
1st thing i did was put 2 strips of velcro on the back to keep it from sliding around!
outstanding for the price!
after playing a bit i realized the way this is setup is awkward... so i switched the jacks, moved the sticker, and turned it around. this switch isn't slanted toward the operator so it makes no difference. this way it's configured the same as my other pedals.
