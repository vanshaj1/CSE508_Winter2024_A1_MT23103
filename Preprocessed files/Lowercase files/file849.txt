a great product, which made a wonderful under-bed light in our application.

- length is perfect for a kings size frame,  start about 1 food from the headboard, and this will cover the permitter all the way around, with adjustment for your particular bed

- the dimming feature is great and a must if you will use it for a nightlight application.  in fact, the lights are so bright you have to keep them at or near the dimmest level for an under-bed nightlight application.

- every led lit up.  no dead diodes.

why the deduction?

- the adhesive back could be stickier.  i used regular scotch tape to strength where it would not adhere.  i think it will stick best to non-textured and gloss surfaces.

- the lead wire going to an from the dimmer would ideally be about 3-6" longer on each end.

- although i purchased the warm light, like most leds, the color temperature becomes cooler with dimming.
