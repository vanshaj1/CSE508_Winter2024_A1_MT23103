this stereo audio jack splitter worked smoothly for me, allowing me to connect 2 headphones to one audio output and also to connect an audio output from a music keyboard to a pc and headphones simultaneously. it's inexpensive and came without any instructions or retail packaging, while it was fine for my needs.
