have never tried these before- just put them on two of my basses. i usually play a set of strings 'til a string breaks- so a very long time. after about a month of playing they still sound fairly new, i think they sound good, feel good, and have even response up and down and across the fretboard.

in the pictures i included, the epiphone accu-bass is a string-through body (to explain why the silks line up differently).

i will have to update this review later after i get more experience with playing these strings, but so far so good.
