i got mine at a music store, not here, but wanted to give a review. first, it is a $40 uke... so people need to keep this in mind. i got it to play a campfires,  the beach, by my hot tub, etc. i am not expecting  it to sound like wood. given that, i am very pleased. it is a great novelty item. people say theirs does not stay in tune, but mine does.  i can hang it on the wall and not touch it for several months. it  is still pretty much in tune, with some minor adjustment. but i would expect that from a wooden or more expensive one as well.  i added some miniature lights off amazon and it certainly serves its purpose.  enough light to see if i want to play in the dark, and also can be festive as well.  i have never regretted purchasing this.
