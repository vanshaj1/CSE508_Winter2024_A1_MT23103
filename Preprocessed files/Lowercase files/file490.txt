exactly what i needed! the wall mounts were extremely inexpensive, are nothing super fancy because i just needed something to hold my stuff to the wall, not to look super expensive and fancy, and work perfectly well. i have three guitars, two of which are in my little "man cave" so that i can just grab and play when i feel like it, and one of which is hanging out of reach of my four-year-old because it has sentimental value that she'll eventually learn to stop trying to touch.

(seriously though: if you know someone getting a phd, a sword is an awesome gift and you should do that.)

the hanger hooks do what they say they should, look perfect, and i'll be buying more as we add more stringed instruments to the house. my daughter wants a ukulele, my wife's violin will need one when it's strung, and whatever else comes in that we want to learn. these will be our wall mounts of choice.
