over the period of a month, one of the two cables failed. when i unplugged it, the actual quarter inch end broke off as i was pulling the cable out as i normally do at the end of practicing or a show, and got stuck in my amp so thanks to this, i have to spend money and time that i don't have to get my amp fixed with the broken cable and buy a better, stronger, more durable cable that won't break when i pull it out of the amp.
