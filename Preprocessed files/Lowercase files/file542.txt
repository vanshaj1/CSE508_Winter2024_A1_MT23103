looking at these on a guitar when they don't have a single wrap on the post, i found it hard to believe the strings would even stay on but i have now installed two sets of these on two different guitars. one black set and the other is gold. the first guitar would not stay in tune so i tried these. they have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. the second set i put on my brand new gibson les paul only because the first ones worked so well. super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. at 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. i prefer these over grover or any other higher priced tuners available.
i have added a few pictures. the new tuners covered the holes on my les paul so it looks great from the back. the other is an ibanez ar420. you can see the original mounting holes so i filled them with wood putty and will use model car paint to match to cover the spots.
