i'm a long time musician, and a long time user of ernie ball strings (on electric guitars). unfortunately, i can't endorse these strings, even though they sound great and the light gauge saves my fingers. the problem is that they break, in my humble opinion, excessively easily. i put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. it snapped near the saddle, so i didn't think much of it. i replaced the set, and within a few more days i noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret. i bought 7 sets, so i still have 5 more sets to go through, but honestly i'll probably go back to elixirs when these are gone, since they seem to last longer.

*update*
i purchased these strings on 12/19. it' now 1/18, and i've broken 3 strings from 3 different packs.
at this point, i really hate these strings.
