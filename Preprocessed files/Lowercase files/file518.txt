this stand is great. its light weight and sturdy base when extended to 9ft. it has screws for 8 lights so you can fit any size light on the t-bar. i have an eliminator lighting katana led, on one side and it takes up about 3 of the screw locations. you can fit a single projector light on this stand if you remove the t-bar. pictures show a close up of the screw that hold the t-bar/projector light.
