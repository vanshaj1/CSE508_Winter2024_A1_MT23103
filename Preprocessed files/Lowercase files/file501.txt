the cable came just as advertised, it was thick, well made and appealing to the sight and touch. customer care was excellent and i haven't even used the cable yet. i'm positive it will proform as good as the company has with its follow up on purchase. this is what anyone who shops hopes for in a company and it is rare in today's consumer goods climate. that you very much and from that i highly recommend this product to all customers seeking cables for there pro gear. dj sinista 1 -alwayz mobile productions.
