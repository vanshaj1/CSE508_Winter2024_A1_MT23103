i purchased this unit primarily for sweetening up a violin pickup and an acoustic guitar with an lr baggs pickup. i'm highly impressed with the improvement in the acoustic guitars tone and character. the parametric equalizer is fantastic for dialing in perfect tone. the unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when i tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. in microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. this is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. i own an art tube mp preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the mp. thanks to behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. the only knock i can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own. it would be nice if they had included some application recommendations for basic settings,
