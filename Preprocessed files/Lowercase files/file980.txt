new fave strings for my fender jaguar & jazzmaster! it gives my offsets extra balls. unlike many flats which tend to sound dull/plucky and higher tension, these would still give you enough brightness and liveliness with a surprisingly balanced sound throughout all strings. it will be tuned fast and stays in tuned for weeks, they only need very minor tuning every now and then. even the wounded g doesn't bother me, it's pretty subtle you almost wouldn't feel it. it's actually cheap considering how long these strings would last.

this will be my last brand of strings that i use from now on.
