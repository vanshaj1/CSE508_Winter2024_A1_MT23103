if you're looking for an inexpensive party light, this is a great option.  the beams are pretty tight and is really set off with a fog machine.  the speaker inside was shocking at first (when you plug it in there is a commanding voice talking about bluetooth connectivity.)  there is a little wireless remote that is useful within 10 feet or so.  the motor is a bit loud but with music playing you won't notice.

there is one piece of functionality that i'm not sure about, and that's music sync.  i don't intend to serve music from this speaker, like i imagine most people.  i've got a speaker system already, and i want this to respond to that system.  there is a built-in microphone, but the (generally confusing) instructions only acknowledge it's there.  as far as i can tell, it will only sync with music coming from its own speaker, but not from the mic.  the mic seems to serve no purpose.  i'd like to get an answer from 1byone on this.

i don't *need* music sync as there is plenty of movement otherwise (enough to not send it back) but it would sure be nice.
