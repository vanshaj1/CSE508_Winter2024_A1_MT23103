i cannot say enough good things about this particular guitar strap. i have several walker & williams straps and not a one of them is a loser, but when i pulled this out of the packaging yesterday, i immediately fell in love with it. buttery smooth, real leather smell, nice stitching - just an overall quality piece of work. looks beautiful on my hagstrom. couldn't be happier.
