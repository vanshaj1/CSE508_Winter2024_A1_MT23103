i used to own a boss cs-3. this pedal is almost as good for less than 1/2 the price and footprint.

it's built very well for the price. i got silly and replaced the black knob with a clear acrylic one to make it look cooler.

i have the donner morpher as well. this stuff is seriously good for the price. mooer is the only other contender in this price and size range. i run this into a mooer tender octaver and wow. wowwwy wow wow
