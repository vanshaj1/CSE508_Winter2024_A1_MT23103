it was exactly as i expected. sounds great under all circumstances! hot sound, without being harsh. serious attitude. serious attack. sounds great clean also. all of this, without losing the guitar's natural voice. installed it in a '78 stratocaster, and gave it a new life. it's just too bad that it took me decades to finally take the plunge to switch from a super d. (which had been my go to in all my guitars since the mid 80s).
