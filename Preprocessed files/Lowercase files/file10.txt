awesome stand!

tip: the bottom part that supports the guitar had a weird angle when arrived, making the guitar slide back, becoming almost 100% on a vertical.
to solve this, i assembled the product and the put a some pressure on the support frame, making it bend a little. now my guitar sits perfectly. check photos!
