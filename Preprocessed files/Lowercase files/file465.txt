this is a great, sturdy stand.  i'm using it for a classical and a flamenco guitar, and they are very secure in the stand.  it's also easy to lift either guitar out without banging one into the other even while seated.  i've also set a concert ukulele in the double stand with no problem.

it's not really portable, so best to leave this one at home.  for a portable stand i like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/donner-ds-1-bass-guitar-stand-for-acoustic-guitar-travel-guitar-stand-silver/dp/b015s95ynk/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">donner ds-1 bass guitar stand for acoustic guitar,travel guitar stand - silver</a>.

i only wish there was a bit of padding where the body leans against the stand, but it's easy enough to make something to put over that spot.
