for the price, this is awesome. the heel is larger than a standard fender neck. if you're building the body, just make a template off the neck itself. the nut is cheap plastic. buzz at high e 5th fret was fixed just by tapping lightly on the fret with a small hammer. fret ends are sharp but not dangerous. not too fat, nor thin. truss rod turned free and easy.
will be getting the rosewood finger board next.
