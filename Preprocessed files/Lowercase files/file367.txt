worked for maybe 30 minutes then it died and never came back on. used standard pedal power supply to power it. what i heard sounded good, but its internals died so quickly. tried batteries, and other power supplie afterwards. nothing worked. refunded and got a dr. scientist pedal and have been amazed.
