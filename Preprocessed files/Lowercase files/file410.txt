these pedals are great!! a friend of mine said i should buy other pedals because these pedals aren't manufactured by a very known brand name but i went with my own judgement and i was not disappointed with them. i have increased my speed a lot since i've gotten em and i can pedal songs like "all nightmare long" and "beast and the harlot" now  =]  great pedals. but, it takes time to develop speed so don't think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can't go all jason costa on em
