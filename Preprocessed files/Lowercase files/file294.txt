i settled on the kelly shu only after reading lots of reviews (of the shu, may, and gibraltar offerings). i chose the shu because it seemed to be the most robust to physical abuse and offers varied placement options. i installed on my 16 x 16 inch pearl session floor tom conversion and attached an audix d6--a rather substantial kick drum mic that is hangs pretty heavy toward the front. i got a little creative with the install, attaching all eight leather straps around the circumference of the drum and weaving the rubber cord (full length) back and forth around the shu (see photos). i used the may no-drill vent hole mic cable adapter to wire it up. i'm very pleased with the design and quality of the kelly shu. figuring out how to install it was a fun challenge--there were several options and i settled on the one that didn't require me to cut the rubber cord, just in case i change my mind.
