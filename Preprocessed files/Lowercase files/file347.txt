at the price point and what it deliveres it's a must buy. i play bass. only a few things i can gripe about and it's the clarity of the notes not being as clear and the split with the music (aux) and headphones..gotta find the right spot. that said it's built great for plastc...very sturdy..and the fact i can use aaa batteries and not lithium built in is what sold me over others too! (buy your own batteries)  comes with cheap batteries. the device works so well i can change two batteries but if the built in stop working and it fades away.. device is no good. nobody knows i'm evening practicing or jamming. very nice should have baught along time ago. i use beats headphones and uiisii us90 ear buds sold on amazon..the best earbuds you will find!($10!) find them!  why the beats? i use the cord for aux to phone. but u can get an aux cord ..(preference)
