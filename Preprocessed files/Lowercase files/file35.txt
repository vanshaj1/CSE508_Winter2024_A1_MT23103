thus should be a 5 star review, but sadly, it's only a 3. i bought a cymbal off of ebay that was a mess. i got it for next to nothing and figured i would clean it up. cleaner sure worked well and then thankfully i read to not use on the letters. holy cow i was this close to cleaning up those areas when thankfully someone called me and i read the entire bottle to the very end.

so the finished product is what you see. a far better cleaned up cymbal but still looks like a wreck around the letters. oh well. light years better than the ebay mess i bought. but i sorely wish i could clean around the lettering with no fear of losing the lettering. you would think zildjian would be able to make a cleaning product that works well around the letters, no?
