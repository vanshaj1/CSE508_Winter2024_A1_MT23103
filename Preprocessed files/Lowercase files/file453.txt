the first one of these i used, did not work at all. after troubleshooting, i solder out the tone control and switched it for the volume pot that seemed to be shorted out perhaps from too much heat from the ground soldering on the back from the factory. everything worked but there was still hum that i eliminated by running it through an effects pedal. the second one worked but had overwhelming static and hum, but it was cheap. i wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. it works fine now but with a little hum. i may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. i would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. in the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, i would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. but, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at radio shack would have been more expensive in the end. you can't beat the price.
