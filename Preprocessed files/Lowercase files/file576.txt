at first i hesitated because $30 seemed a lot for a mic stand but i decided to just keep the order. it came in about 4 days immediately and i set it up. wow the quality is amazing. it extends pretty high and far. i was worried at first it would be too small but it soon proved me wrong. there are no flaws. i will definitely order another one soon for my second mic. this product was great and there's a reason this was rated 5 stars. great for home studio budgets. highly recommend!
