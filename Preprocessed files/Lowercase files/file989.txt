awesome quality for the price. i did replace the foam protecting covers with thick rubber, but that's more personal preference than a quality issue. the price for this stand is outstanding. i bought two more, and now have three in all. i keep one at my practice space as well. these stands are completely trustworthy with any standard guitar styles. a flying v, or dimebag model, or even an explorer may not work with these. i am quite satisfied with mine.
