this was a great value. the wood i received looked outstanding and all the parts were there and fit well. i did some customization to the look and added a couple of other pickups for some diversity but the components i received were of reasonable quality. the guitar looks and plays great after a bit of neck adjustment and setup. very satisfied.

(note: like on most all of this type of low priced guitar, the volume pot was dismal. why they don't spend a buck more for a decent volume pot that actually adjusts volume in a linear fashion is a mystery.)
