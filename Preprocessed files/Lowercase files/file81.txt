this strap is well made and is very comfortable. i installed dunlop straploks, which was a chore because the leather is so thick, but i got them on without cutting or modifying the strap. the leather is soft and the padding is nice. i bought another brand of leather strap that claimed it was padded but it wasn't. this strap is nice and cushiony. highly recommended!
