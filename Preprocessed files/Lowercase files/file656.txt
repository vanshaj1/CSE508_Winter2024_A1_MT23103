these locking tuners look great and keep tune.  good quality materials and construction.  excellent upgrade to any guitar.  i had to drill additions holes for installation.  if your neck already comes with pre-drilled holes, then they should drop right in, otherwise you will need to buy a guitar tuner pin drill jig, also available from amazon.
