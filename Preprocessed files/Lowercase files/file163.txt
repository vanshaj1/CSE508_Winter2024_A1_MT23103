i have to give these pickups 5 stars for bang for buck!  i bought this last year for an 96' korean squire that i have been slowly but surely replacing everything on as a learning project.  time marched on and i finally put them in tonight and all i have to say is wow!  the difference in these and the originals is just off the scale.  i never realized how much amp hiss i was getting until i plugged these in for the first time.  i had to actually hit a string to make sure it was working.  i can not say enough good things about these affordable pickups.  i have another mim strat with some boutique pickups that are marketed as noiseless but i honestly believe i actually like the tone of these better for a fraction of the cost. if you have an old strat laying around these are the pickups you need to bring it roaring back to life.  i have attached a pic for those who wonder how the covered pickups look installed.
