man. no words can not be said. i have a catalina maple drum set. once i placed this head on there and that first hit. it sound like a cannon. perfect sound. it make you want to play all day. made me want to start dancing.

i have had my eyes set on the product after the few churchs that i have been to and they have this product and i knew this would be my next purchase. if you are in the market for a new drum head. if you are a hard hitter go with the evans emad2. you will not be disappointed
