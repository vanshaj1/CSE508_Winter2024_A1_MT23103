the cheap black screw broke.

i drilled a starter hole just a hair smaller diameter than the supplied cheap black screw. it broke off manually trying to screw it into the bottom of an acoustic guitar. i was able too clamp a vice grip to the broken end, clamp it, and screw it out. fortunately, i had a neck button with a stainless steel screw to replace it. i installed it but not with the cheap black breakable screw supplied.
