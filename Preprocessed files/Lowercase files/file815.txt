i bought this 2 months ago and just now got a chance to put it on my tele but it does not fit! it's too small and the holes don't match!

edit: i got a response from them and they offered to return 30% of my money back and i get to keep the item. i'm not sure what i could do with it since it doesn't fit my tele but it's good enough, i suppose. i'd rather have 100% of my money back since the product is misleading. maybe it only fits on certain types of telecasters?

edit #2: so they emailed me again and offered a full refund since the item was of no use to me. now that is customer service! customer service like that is few and far between. 5 stars!
