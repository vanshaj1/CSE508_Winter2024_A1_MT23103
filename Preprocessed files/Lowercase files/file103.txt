this is a practical and versatile instrument tuner. it includes a metronome and tone generator and a variety of settings. the clamp attaches easily to an instrument and the tuner can rotate to the angle that is convenient for seeing it. the power and function buttons are easy to use. this does have a few limitations, such as the frequency range limit of 435-445 hz. the meter shows you if you are flat or sharp or right on the note, and this is a precise tuner - you won't get the green light if you are slightly off. i have tried multiple tuners and this one is good, with the extra features that make it a great value and go to accessory for musicians. i received a sample at no cost for my honest, unbiased review.
