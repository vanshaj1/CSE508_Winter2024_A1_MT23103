i have a 35 scale bass so i figured these strings would seem fitting. well, i was wrong and forgot to account that my strings don't get feed through the bridge but get feed through the backside. the tapered part of the stings sit between the 1st fret and nut and causes it to buzz as seen in my photos. if you have a bass set up like mine, go with ernie balls.
