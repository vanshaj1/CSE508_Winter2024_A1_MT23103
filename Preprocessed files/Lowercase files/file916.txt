this bridge cover is beautiful. it really adds flare and character to your bass. i personally added it to a squier bronco bass that i've modded with mustang parts.

be aware that this is much larger than the precision bass bridge cover. if your style is to play at/near the bridge area, this cover will definitely get in the way.

***no screws are included. the standard pickguard screws work just fine. i recommend either buying a pack from amazon, or head to the local hardware store to save some money.
