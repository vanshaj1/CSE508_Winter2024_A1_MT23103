this tailpiece is very solid and the plating and finish couldn't be better. so great for the price. i don't expect plating will stand contact/rubbing for long, but that's the case with most gold plated hardware, so i suggest any gold hardware be handled delicately. i know gold plating costs so much more than its price, so it's a bargain.
