my first effects pedal was the donner blues drive and i absolutely love it! for my birthday this year, i decided to order some more pedals from donner and start building a pedalboard. with the quality and affordability of these pedals, you really can't go wrong. i play mostly in church with our praise band and this chorus pedal works perfectly for what i need it for!
