this light is awesome!!! very bright with 54 one watt diodes. throws a nice medium wash they are great. the only down side i have with them is a power cable being attached to the fixture instead of an iec cable. it has dmx in and out. the housing is a very tough plastic and also includes the hanging bracket. the par is a flat par which is great for up lighting. i think this is a great fixture so i give it a 5 stars
