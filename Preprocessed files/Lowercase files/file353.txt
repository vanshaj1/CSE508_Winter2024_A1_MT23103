simple to install and it works. i have an old ibanez rg that i just didn't want to fuss with as far as tuning adjustments. installed this with an extra spring and really tightened up the claw into the body, works as advertised. the coolest part is how you can set your bridge height before the final claw adjustment. can still dive if i want but i'm just having fun playing the rg again in alternative tuning. i can go from 1/2 step down van halen right back up to standard leads w/o having to access the cavity. i may get a tremol-no for my american strat as i feel this is too limiting for a more expensive guitar.
