i wanted to customize my fake plastic rock band guitar&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/the-beatles-rock-band-x360-wireless-rickenbacker-325-guitar-controller/dp/b0028n13gc/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">the beatles: rock band x360 wireless rickenbacker 325 guitar controller</a>&nbsp;with inexpensive tuning pegs. these fit the bill and i'm happy with the end result.
pictures of finished project uploaded in uploaded customer images.
however, if i needed tuning pegs on my real guitar, i would surely go with a better choice. pay a little more for better quality.
