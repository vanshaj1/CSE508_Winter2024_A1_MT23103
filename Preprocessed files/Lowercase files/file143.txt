arrived 3 days after i ordered it, the bent welding should've clued me to what would happen. 2nd time i tuned it the inferior quality tension bolts started stripping, making the macho (small drum) useless. mostly good materials (oak, steel, rawhide) + terrible craftmanship = drum being returned. lay down another $30 and get some aspires, i've gotten 2 sets of those (1 for me, 1 as a gift) and they won't let you down, or you might want to check out similarly priced bongos from meinl, gon bops or tycoon, but avoid this hunk a junk.
