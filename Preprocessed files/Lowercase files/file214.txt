a lot of the reviews for this are divided. "oh, it sounds great," and "sounds like a s***ty gong" come to mind. i bought it anyways. it is definitely a cheap buy, and still looks like an amazing cymbal. as for sound, it does sound pretty crappy. but it's still a great buy for beginner drummers, or drummer who just like to jam out in their basements/garage. once you start to get a gig or two, you should consider going with a better cymbal

update: i've had the cymbal for about 1.5 years, and it's cracked to the point where i can't play it anymore. it's most likely because of the way i've been hitting it, and not because of crappy manufacturing. as i look at my old review i think i was a bit critical. i've grown to love the bright sound of this cymbal, and will probably buy another one
