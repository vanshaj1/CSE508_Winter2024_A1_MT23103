hot damn!  i replaced the original neck position humbucker on my 1980 les paul (which i bought new) with a sph90 phat cat.  what a difference!!  it is much louder, and brighter, and all around sweeter and more tuneful that the original.  i used to rarely use the neck pickup alone.  now i'll use it almost exclusively (though mixing in a bit of the bridge humbucker is sweet too).  i'm very glad i bought this and made the switch.  p.s. - i've had no problem with hum from this pickup - if you do, your problem is probably somewhere in your amp.
