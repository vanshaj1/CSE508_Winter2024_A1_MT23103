this thing works!  i use a dw 3000 double-pedal, and have had issues with the slave pedal sliding forward - even though it comes with it's own built-in spurs.  the dw's onboard spurs are about where the ball of the foot goes, so with the pedal jumping, even when extended all the way down, the pedal still moved (hopped?) forward.  i tried adding additional velcro, but that didn't stop it.  but now, with the pearl pedal stabilizer on the front of it, it stays put.  the pearl's long spikes go deep into my old oriental carpet that i use as my drum rug at a perfect angle to restrict any forward movement.  now i can really kick it hard!  pleasantly surprised at how heavy-duty and large it is.  if your slave pedal has a hoop clamp on it, you're ready to go right out of the package.  the spikes also can be reversed with rubber tips for hard surfaces.  i don't really need that feature as my rug goes with me to gigs.
