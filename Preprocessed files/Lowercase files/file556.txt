i bought this after watching a review on youtube; search: "satchel yamaha thr10x".  this little beast sounds so big for how small it is.  i used to have a small crate for a practice amp... that's not a practice amp.  this is a practice amp... you won't have to sacrifice tone to play in your bedroom/office.
