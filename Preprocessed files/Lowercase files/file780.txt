i purchased this to protect my jim dandy guitar when i'm out and about.  it is a parlor sized guitar and needed a fairly snug fit - a regular dread bag was just way too big.

the jim dandy measures 36  tall x 13  wide x 4  deep, and this bag fit perfect.  pics included to show how it works.

i paid $25 and it was well worth it.
