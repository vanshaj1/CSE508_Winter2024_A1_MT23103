i purchased the gator gk-2110 for my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/boss-rc-300-loop-station/dp/b005p4nvji/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">boss rc-300 loop station</a>&nbsp;and for a small keyboard in the future.  i chose this over gator's multi fx bag because it was a better fit lengthwise for my pedal.  it's interesting that the tag on the bag states that it will fit controllers up to 21" x 10" x 5".  my pedal is 21 1/8" and fits fine.

one minor complaint i have is that the shoulder strap adjustment buckle prevents you from placing the pad in the middle of the strap if you tighten the strap from just before medium to "tightened all the way."  this is not a big deal to me, because i can sew/create a better strap system.

i have an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/akai-pro-miniak-virtual-analog-synthesizer-with-vocoder/dp/b002maaw4u/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">akai pro miniak virtual analog synthesizer with vocoder</a>, and this keyboard bag will not fit.  i had to add that because i saw this bag "pop up" on the "what customers buy after viewing this (akai miniak) item."
