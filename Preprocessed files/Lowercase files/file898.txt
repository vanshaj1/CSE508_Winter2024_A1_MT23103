this braided cable is one of the nicest i've ever used that was under $50. the sound is crisp and not distorted with no buzz or ground hum, even jumping on the cable did not produce any undesired sound bleed. the ends are gold plated for increased connectivity and the ends are well shielded with a quality heat shield tubing covering the wire connections. the end covers are well threaded and do not loosen themselves after use. i have been playing for 15 years now both live and studio and haven't found cables this nice that did not have a hefty price tag. i plan to pick up a few more of these in different lengths to replace some others i've used i like them that much. i did receive this product at a discount in return for a fair unbiased opinion. if my review was helpful to you please click the yes button.
