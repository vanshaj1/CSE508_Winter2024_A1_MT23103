i first considered the cordoba concert ukulele because it was on every list of the best beginner ukes, and i am so happy with my choice! it took about a week to stretch the strings and stay in tune, but the cordoba sounds amazing. my daughter has a cheaper soprano uke and the cordoba has a noticeably clearer sound and is much lighter weight. it just feels great in my hands. i tried some no-drill straps, but ultimately chose to add a strap button with no problem. i saw some reviews about quality control issues on the finish, and i did find a rough spot on the back (see photo). this was not an issue for me, but i'd suggest checking for this. otherwise, i love everything about my cordoba ukulele and highly recommend it for beginners. from my experience so far, it's worth spending a little more to get a quality instrument.
