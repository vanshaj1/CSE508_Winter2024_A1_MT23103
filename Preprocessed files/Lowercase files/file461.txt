has a great sound to it, a really wonderful tone. i would highly recommend it over any other phaser in the same price range and maybe double its price range, nothing can touch it in terms of its sonic quality, and it's a great bargain for the money. no hum and coloring of tone. built like a tank and has a small foot print on your board. sounds very close to the mxr phase 90, just a bit more suttle and a lot smaller. i was a little worried after i ordered the pedal. being used to a mutron bi-phase, i didn't know how the donner would perform. boy, was i surprised. not only could i get that van halen phase sound, i also got a great classic alabama, waylon sound too. it is built rugged and simple. who could ask for more.
