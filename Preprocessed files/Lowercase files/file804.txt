what a great new preamp from fishman the platinum stage. it so small fits in a guitar case.  it gets rid of the low mud tone. in guitar mode the bass is at 150hz, theres a low cut switch for 30hz, 80hz, and 160hz.  the middle is from 200hz-3.1khz q1.3 and treble is at 6khz.  i like that this is battery powered so i can use it with the bose s1 pro and my guitars with lr baggs or fishman pickups.  on the cordoba f7 paco w fishman ellipse it sounds great.  thanks fishman #fishmanelectronics #fishman
