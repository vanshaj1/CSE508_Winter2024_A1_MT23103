finally a cheap neck that is as advertised!!!
i've bought 3 cheap necks, and this is by far the best of the 3. the first 2 were utter garbage, will be send one back asap, the other i kept for a dye experiment.
okay so back to this neck.
 mine came with a very good flame, decent inlays and fairly straight. solid finish, although is a bit in the orange side. really a quality neck. i'll be ordering a couple more, and see if i just got lucky with mine.
packaging totally sucked, but mine came in unscathed. i'll be changing my rating if my other 2 come damaged. an individual box would have been nice.
