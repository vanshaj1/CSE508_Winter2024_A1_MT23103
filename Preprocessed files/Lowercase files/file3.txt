we use these for everything from our acoustic bass down to our ukuleles. i know there is a smaller model available for ukes, violins, etc.; we haven't yet ordered those, but these will work on smaller instruments if one doesn't extend the feet to their maximum width. they're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.

the greatest benefit has been when writing music at the computer and needing to set a guitar down to use the keyboard/mouse - just easier for me than a hanging stand.

we have several and gave one to a friend for christmas as well. i've used mine on stage, and it folds up small enough to fit right in my gig bag.
