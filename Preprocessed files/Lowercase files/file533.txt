love it! i have had other tuners & recently bought a pedal tuner. i like this because it's much more convenient. the pedal wears through 9 volt batteries pretty quick, so i'm constantly plugging & unplugging. w/ this one, i just move it from one headstock to another & turn it on/off as desired...

note: using it for at home/practice/recording...
