rock solid, and everything you need to hang your instrument.  someone's review stated that they were ugly.  seriously?  i used to buy these for about $25 a piece, and they all look the same.  these get the job done at about 1/3 of the price of most music shops, and if i can trust my gibson and martin guitars on them, they are solid.
