i've got a five person band for our hawaiian performing arts group. these headsets make for even audio. no fading in and out as a singer moves closer or farther away from the mic, or turns her face to the right or left. they use the shure sm58 pick-ups which are time proven. these headsets are especially good when i want to record a live performance. anyone want to buy my stick mics and stands?
