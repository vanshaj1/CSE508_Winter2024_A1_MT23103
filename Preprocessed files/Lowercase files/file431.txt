nicely made, very secure, very plush on the inside.  and a bit heavy, but it keeps the guitar safe from my klutzy self.

i originally ordered this case for my luna safari muse nylon guitar; it's a bit roomy for the luna but a little bit of padding on the bout end of the case makes the safari more secure.  i bought a cordoba cadete 3/4 guitar shortly after ordering the case, and the cadete fits like the case was made for it - no movement at all in the case.
