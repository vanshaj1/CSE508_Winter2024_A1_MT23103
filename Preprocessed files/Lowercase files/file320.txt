brass tacks: is this the greatest mic in the world? no. but on a budget this mic is amazing. the lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out. if you are looking for s nice rich sound, this is it.

if you want to upgrade from a headset, cheap mic, blue yeti, or at-2020; buy this mic and an audio interface. you won't regret it.
