i love this thing. it works as a volume pedal, wah pedal and expression pedal, all in one. also, the wah sounds amazing. the small size of the top plate makes it a breeze to use and pull off all kinds of things that are much more difficult with a full size wah.  in short, it's built like a tank, sounds amazing and looks great :)
