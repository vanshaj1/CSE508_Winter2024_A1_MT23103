they were perfect! man i love them....
they were a little late in delivry as it was expected...
but once since they are on my jet gretsch....
it stay tune, fast change, no pain even with a bigsby....
i can even do "riff detuning" like they do in rockabilly music.
i wouldn't suggest them.... i would buy it as a gift!
