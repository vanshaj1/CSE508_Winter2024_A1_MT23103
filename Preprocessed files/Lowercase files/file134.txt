i think that this is a great product (because it is for a complete keyboard), but i do have one tiny, tiny problem... they are so tiny that i can't see them.  i looked at many vendors for this type of product and because yours ran the full gambit, i chose it.  if you have any that are larger and has all 88 keys, i'll trade with you!
