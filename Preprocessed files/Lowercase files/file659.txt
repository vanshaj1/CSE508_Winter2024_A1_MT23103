well... i guess the truth is this product is not for everyone.
quality does not compare with a regular amp.
you need to purchase apps to be able to get anything out of it.
i guess its for people who are mobile and don't want or cant take their amp with them?
since i play at home, i wouldn't change using my fender amp to use this on an ipad or iphone ever.
i am returning the product now, but if you fit the mobile type, you should get it. best option out there
