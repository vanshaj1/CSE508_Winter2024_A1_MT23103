in theory this is a great pedal but they are notorious for having problems freezing up. mine is basically a paper weight right now. it has to go to a service center to be reset. from everything i've read on forums, odds are that it will probably freeze up again after being repaired. hopefully not but i'm not feeling very optimistic. when / if tc gets the software to be more stable then this would be a fantastic product but until that happens i can't recommend it.
