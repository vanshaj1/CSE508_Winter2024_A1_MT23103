these stands are balanced, sturdy and lightweight. the locking strap is a nice feature but not even necessary. not sure how some people are placing their guitars, but unless they have a defecting unit, it's pretty impossible to mess up. i use one for my gibson grabber bass and the other for my taylor 114e acoustic. works great for both!
