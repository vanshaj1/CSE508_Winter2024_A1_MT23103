i love this little guy. i was looking for a simple combo amp to use at the church i play at. this amp is plenty loud, and has great sound quality. that's it. no frills. and it looks cool too.

i should mention that the arrangement of the church group is just a piano, guitar, and vocals. with that arrangement, i have my volume about 1/3 of the way up. haven't tried this amp against drums yet, but i'm fairly confident it would cut through. at least playing with "church drums."
