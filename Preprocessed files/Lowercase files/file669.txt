these are 7" tall at the microphone, doesn't matter how you have the legs 7" is how tall they are.
(look at picture)
picture taken with 4" palm sander for height scale.
they are heavy duty and are perfect for miking a small guitar amp sitting on the floor which is why i bought them.
they shipped 1 week faster then amazon said they would.
i would buy more if i needed more. |
