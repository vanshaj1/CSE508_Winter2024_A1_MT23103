for the money they aren't bad but that doesn't mean they are good. loud highs and lows get fuzzy and the over all doesn't sound great but for a small gig band or a backup mics these are great! the only prob i have with them is that the mic mount doesn't fit on like any mic stand i have and buy a cheep pop filter for this mic or you will regret it!!!!
