it's bigger than i expected and when you pull it out of the box it comes in it has this square shape. lol. i like it and will hold on to the box just for that. fits perfectly easy on off. the black area is rubber. i thought it would be foam. pretty good at wind protection. no popping. it looks good with the h4n pro. a few loose hairs and sheds a little bit but hopefully all the loose ones with be gone after a little while.
