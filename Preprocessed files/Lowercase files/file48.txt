these strings were reccomended to me by an acquaintance of mine during a bass clinic i attended recently.  i ordered them right away.. all i can say is wow! excellent tone. it really brightened up my sound. i had gotten used to muddy sounding strings.  i haven't noticed a sticky feeling like others have mentioned, mine are silky smooth. great playability. wasn't too concerned about color, but when i installed them on my ferrari red carvin lb 70, i fell in love with my bass all over again.  it looks stunning, and i get many comments about my bass now..others have mentioned that the color wears off quickly, but i don't care, i'll used the color wear as a guage of when to change them..then neon ones even glow brightly under a black light.  bass players don't get much credit so why not give them a show and something to talk about.
