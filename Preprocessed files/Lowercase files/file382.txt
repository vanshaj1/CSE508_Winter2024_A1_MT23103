after much online shopping, and 20 years of using traditional stands, i needed something with easier access and greater stability than the standard 3 leg stands. i had six guitars in stands, and this hercules unit had the best reviews. the box arrived in great shape, and i pulled out the stand and popped it open and it was ready to go. included was additional parts to add a 6th guitar to the stand, which i needed. very easy to configure the spacing, and load the guitars, stable. now it is easy for me to grab a guitar to play and then put away. i have an acoustic, 3 electrics, a semi-hollow body electric (e335 style), and a bass. highly recommended.
