absolutely amazing! i think they are direct knock-off of seymour duncan sh-2 jazz model humbucker pickups. (you can see the same little holes on each of pups) powerful, bright sound, no noise. my old johnson lp with ex "emg-ish"  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. great quality! thanks everyone for good review.
