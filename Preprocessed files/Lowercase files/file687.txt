this is my 2nd donner dp-1. the first was purchased to replace a noisy daisy-chain supply. ran 8 effects, including the line 6 dl4 (with the reverse polarity adapter) without any noise, power interruptions, or channel failures. from what i understand (after a lot of reading/research), these seem to be independent channels, but share a common ground. i'm not an electrician, but i do know that whether i'm running through my amp at home, or through the pa at church, i'm getting zero noise. quite content with these.
