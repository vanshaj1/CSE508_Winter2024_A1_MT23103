here's the thing about xlr cables. if they work, they work and you never notice them. if they don't work, they create more of an issue than you can dream. i purchased 2 cbi cables and received them within the appropriate time line and they were well packed. however, as you will see in the photos below, one of the cables was absolutely a terrible cable to send out. the connectors were covered in some sort of sticky mess and the phillips screw was completely stripped out on of the connectors. terrible terrible experience for me. i will attempt to return this cable and receive another from the company.
