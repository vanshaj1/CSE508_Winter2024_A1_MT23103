just got my pedal board yesterday!  i love it.  before i had my pedals strewn all over the floor.  now they're organized and easier to use.  the board is larger than i expected b/c i didn't pay attention to the measurements in the description.  but i'm glad i chose this one.  it gives me an excuse to purchase more pedals.  obviously the stock photo shows many pedals placed really close together which is not realistic considering the cables that are involved.  i'm attaching photos of my board for better reference.  eventually, as i add more pedals i will place the power supply under the board, but for now i like the blue illumination of the agp power supply.

i definitely recommend this board as it is very sturdy and comes with everything you need to set it up.  i had a blast configuring my simple set up!  rock on fellow musicians!
