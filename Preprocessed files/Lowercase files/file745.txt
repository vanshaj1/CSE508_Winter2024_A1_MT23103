go up 1 size. my hands are not large for my size and they are certainly not thick. i wear a size medium glove comfortably and large is almost always too big. yet a size medium in these barely squeezes onto my pinky. sizing is not close to accurate. even used a heat gun to expand the opening slightly, no go. just makes them wider but thinner. disappointed
