i've been playing promark 747s for decades....  because my wife likes porcupine tree and gavin harrison (so do i), she surprised me with a pair of these and i was blown away.  great grip and great feel.  i've never played with grippy anything but i sure do love it.  i did finally break the pair after some time and it's time for a new pair....  i just with i could roll them on a flat surface to be sure they're straight and not warped which i've been bitten by before with online stick purchases.  here they were before breakage.
