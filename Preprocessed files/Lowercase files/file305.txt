this pedalboard is the best value entry level board ive seen on amazon.... very well made, sits on floor with a good angle, very useful slats and spacing to make cables tidy underneath so you can organise the pedals in a non linear fashion  .  its big enough to grow into. love the lightweight aluminum. velcro straps come with it to strap on your mini power supply (donner psu no less lol).  i also hid my noise suppressor underneath since thats an always-on pedal.  this way, you get even more pedal space on top. i fit all my pedals and probably room for one or two mini pedals or one more regular sized pedal.

two complaints:

wouldve been kind for donner to throw in long strips of velcro too but nope.... no included velcro.

carrying case is cheap with almost no real padding. couldve given a tad more padding here.
