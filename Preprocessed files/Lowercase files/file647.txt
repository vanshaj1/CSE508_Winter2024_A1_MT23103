i purchased this from a different store with a gift card. it lasted less than 10 string changes. the design could be easily remedied by using a metal shaft instead of a piece of plastic. after it broke, it took about 10 minutes for me to drill the hole out a little and then put a screw in there. works fine now. if you are up for purchasing a thing that's going to last a few times and then spend a little time fixing it, then this is your product!
