i installed these grovers to my ltd and it went smooth as can be! absolutly no problems. the strings i installed were new and held their tune far better than than new strings without the locking feature. i was a bit nervous because these do not have a button type to secure the strings. grover has another mechanisim to lock the strings in place. it works great! just make sure you hear the click! its not loud so you may want to install these in a quiet place. read the directions carefully and your all set. i put a set of the same grovers on my cheapy johnson hollowbody. perfect fit!
