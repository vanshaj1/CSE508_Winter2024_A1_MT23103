i got this for my son for christmas and he really loves it.  he also as a condenser mic that needs phantom power in order to work.  with this focusrite scarlett 2i2 audio interface that eliminates that requirement as it also doubles as phantom power.  the mic is very clear when using this recording device.  he uses the magix music maker to record his music.  it is excellent and he has not had any issues with it at all.  i asked him if there was anything negative about it and he said all he can think of is how perfect it is.  you can adjuster mic volume, very clear, he has not heard any cut outs.  the only con is if you leave it plugged in to the usb when you are not using it your voice will sound static, but he said its an easy fix you just unplug the usb and plug it back in.  by the way he is using an old dell laptop and it works great.
i am very happy with this purchase and recommend it.
