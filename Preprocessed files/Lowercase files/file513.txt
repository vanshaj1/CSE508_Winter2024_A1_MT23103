best tone i've ever played... personally, this pedal played with my mustang v solid state amp just make it sound unbelievably good... every not i feel it so delicate, et powerful. this pedal is very subtle in it's effect, but for those with an ear to listen can tell the amazing rich tone this pedal produces. please connect it on the fx send return channels of your amp, otherwise if placed in front the pre amp of the pedal will create a little noise...
 all and all... i think my tone has been perfected... thanks to joyo and his amazing yet unbelievably inexpensive products... simply amazing. buy it, cannot go wrong with the price. i was saving 1,500 bucks for a twin reverb. no need. not anymore. :)
