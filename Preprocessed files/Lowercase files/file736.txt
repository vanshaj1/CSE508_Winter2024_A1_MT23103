for the price, it can't be beat. i hadn't picked up a fiddle in 50 years, so i didn't want to invest a lot of money in something i wouldn't use, but i was pleasantly surprised by this instrument. of course it's not a high dollar violin, but there is nothing wrong with it.

edit (after five weeks): i just changed the strings and there is good and bad. first, the bad: the holes for the strings in the tuning pegs had to have been drilled by a nearsighted drunkard. they were all way off-center and most likely weaken the pegs.
now for the good: i replaced the original strings with d'addario pro arte strings and it made a world of difference. it now sounds just as a violin should and is much more enjoyable to play.
