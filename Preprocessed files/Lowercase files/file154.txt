i manage a classic rock band. i recently ordered a bunch of stuff to replace aging gear. cables, mics, stands, snakes, etc. we have now been out on a couple of gigs with the stuff. it is all good quality and working fine. does exactly what i expected it to do. no surprises. in the interest of time i am applying this exact same review to all of the items i bought for this purpose and am happy with. fwiw, i am also taking the time to be critical of the items i am not completely happy with.

i am adding a picture for this road case also.
