needed something cheap but that worked for the bedroom. my main gear is upstairs in my studio but i often practice in my bedroom. i run a little fender champ combo in there and wanted some dirty tones for classic rock, blues and some heavier rock. this did the trick. made of plastic but seems durable enough for my needs. get some really cool tones out of this pedal. can dial in almost any blues or rock tone i want. was impressed by it for such a low cost pedal. for the money it was a very good choice.
