works with a heil pr 40 after taking off the bottom cap. in doing this you need to utilize the piece that comes with your pr40 and secure your mic by screwing it to the bottom of your mic after putting it into the shock mount. would of liked a natural fit without doing this but for the price it can't be beat and works very well.
