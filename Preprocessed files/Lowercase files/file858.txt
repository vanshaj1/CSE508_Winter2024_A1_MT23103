as i said elsewhere, the pick wears on the edges, and breaks very quickly, within hours if you play hard. i use it on an acoustic guitar with medium to light strings, so really! after at least 3 years, i am still using my dunlop medium guitar pick. the rubber part also "hangs" on the low e string, especially if you are trying to hit it for the first beat of the measure or simply for emphasis. this is probably a bad habit, which i could unlearn, but only if the pick would last longer!
why not sell replacement picks (as mentioned by another reviewer: for a quarter), to snap into the rubber holder? then you could also offer light, medium and hard replacement picks.
