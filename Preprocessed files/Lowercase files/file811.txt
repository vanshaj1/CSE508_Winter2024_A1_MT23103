this thing works great. i hooked it up to my atr2100 along with a neewer scissor arm (without a shock mount) and i did some tests to see how my plosives were. it makes a great difference, especially since you have to get pretty close to this type of microphone (dynamic). it may be a cheap buy, but it's definitely quality and does what it needs to.
