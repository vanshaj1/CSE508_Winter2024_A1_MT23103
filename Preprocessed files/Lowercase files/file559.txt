this case is rigid yet lightweight. there seems to be plenty of padding (high density styrofoam?).  in regards to the various sizes, i bought the "electric" size and it fits my new fender strat perfectly.  a fender strat fits snugly without shifting around.  note:  if you have a les paul style guitar, make sure to buy the "les paul" case.  if you buy this electric case, which is what i am reviewing here,  your les paul will not fit!  inside the case there are a couple of areas where you can put a couple of effects pedals, etc.  if you use mini-pedals, you might be able to fit four.  on the outside there is a large, zippered pocket that will fit a small laptop.  plus, another zippered pocket that has see-thru mesh material.  the zippers are large and heavy duty.  this case is much easier to carry than your typical hard case.  plus, it looks classy.  i'm glad i bought it.
