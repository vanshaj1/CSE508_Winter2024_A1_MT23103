this black guard fit perfectly on my squier affinity telecaster that i was doing my rendition of macawber(keith richards telecaster). very impressed with how well it was made. i just had to file out the pickup hole just a little bit for it to fit with ease. but all mounting screw holes lined up and i didn't have to do any fit work that you have to do most of the time, even on more expensive pick guards sometimes. i am very happy with how it looks and fits, i do really like the matte finish of it too.
