i really love playing this guitar. every since i received it, it has been by my side. full sized neck. sustain is fantastic. it stays in tune even with new strings. fits perfectly in my suitcase. will be taking it on all my vacations. i added the foam to the lap rest for a little more comfort while sitting on my lap. plus, to prevent it from sliding when sitting. if you want a great travel guitar or even a guitar to play around the house, this is the one to get.
