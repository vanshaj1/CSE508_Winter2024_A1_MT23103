easy to fit to my violins top with a good sharp knife and some patience, need to get some better sand paper to make it a perfect fit. please note this is not a bridge you can unpack and simply insert you must fit the feet to your violins top. really enjoy the curve of the strings as well. all in all a great step up from the factory fit bridge that came on my instrument.
