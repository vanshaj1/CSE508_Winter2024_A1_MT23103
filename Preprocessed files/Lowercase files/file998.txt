i really like the simplicity of this bridge. it adjusts easy for string height and length. it comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. the provided mounting screws are phillips head screws. the one thing that i missed when i ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. the strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. i included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. no biggie tho for me, i will use it on another project now.
