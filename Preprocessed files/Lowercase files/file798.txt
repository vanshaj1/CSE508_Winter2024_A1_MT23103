this was a gift from my sister and brother in law for babysitting there kids until school start. i have to say this is an amazing guitar. for 200$ it's worth the buy and if your new to 7 string guitars you'll love it. well shipped and a well made guitar. i couldn't be any more happier with the white looks so sick.
