i have 3 daughters and last year i bought my oldest a guitar.  she's been kind of luke warm ever since getting one but my middle daughter has been asking for one for a while now, so this was her birthday gift.  it's what you'd expect it to be....it's a fender, but it's a squier...so it's going to be mass produced "alright" quality for the most part, but not stellar by any means.  nevertheless, it gets the job done (getting someone young interested in the learning process).  be prepared to tighten down the various screws and nuts on the guitar when it arrives (this is why i docked them one star).  personally i dislike strats, but this seemed like the best option to get my kids started on guitar.
