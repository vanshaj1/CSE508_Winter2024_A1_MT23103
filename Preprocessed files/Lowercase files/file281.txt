agreed not for the bonham wanna-b's.
theses sticks have such sensitivity i can feel the earths rotation. a hair longer then my usuals gives me a little more dynamic edge.
can play all night very comfortable, haven't  dropped one yet.
lastly, stupid stick tricks,  require a slight adjustment but can be done.
