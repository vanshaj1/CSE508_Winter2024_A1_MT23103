it's a great deal, very good product for the money, but you need to be aware that your instrument (especially acoustics) will need to have the adjustable center arm raised considerably in order to keep the headstocks from bumping. the higher you raise it, the farther apart the headstocks will be but the higher you raise it the less backward tilt of the guitars. less tilt, less stability, so be sure to use the attached neck holders. the attached photo shows two full size acoustics with the center arm about 80% raised and the headstocks are about an inch apart. any lower and they touch.
