these are decent guitar hangers.  i was worried about hanging an electric due to the weight but it seems to be working just fine.  obviously lighter acoustics are no problem.

the drywall anchors are a cheap plastic and i broke one while installing.  it still worked well enough to support everything.  in the end, i'm happy.
