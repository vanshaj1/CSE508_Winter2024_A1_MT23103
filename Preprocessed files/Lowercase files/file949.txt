i use this with an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/on-stage-my550-microphone-extension-attachment-bar/dp/b0002zo3lk/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">on stage my550 microphone extension attachment bar</a>&nbsp;to mount the mics that come in the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/nady-dmk-5-drum-mic-package/dp/b0002gxumw/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">nady dmk-5 drum mic package</a>. these are relatively small and light microphones, especially the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/nady-dm70-drum-and-instrument-microphone/dp/b0002czqoq/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">nady dm70 drum and instrument microphone</a>.

as you can see in the customer-supplied images at the top of this page this gooseneck holds the dm70 steadily, and has the length to allow me to place the mics where i want them. for example, using two of these and two of the extension bars, i can attach the assemblies to my hi-hat stand and mic both the rack tom, plus the hi-hat and snare drum combined with a separate dm70.

another use i have is to use either this or a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/on-stage-microphone-6-inch-gooseneck-black/dp/b00080f7cs/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">on stage microphone 6-inch gooseneck, black</a>&nbsp;(depending on where i want to place them) off a mic stand using the extension bar as a clamp. this arrangement allows me to place a dm70 for tenor and alto saxophones, or a dm80 for baritones.

for the smaller, lighter mics like the ones i use this is a perfect solution.
