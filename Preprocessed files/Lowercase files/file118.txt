this is a wonderful gig bag! i've included pictures of the more popular styles of guitar so you can see how well they fit. the purple les paul style fits snug length wise with the extra cushion pads, and fits snug side to side. the black stratocaster style is almost to long, but still fits fine. the grey sg style is a small guitar, so there is extra room top to bottom and side to side, but with the neck strap, it doesn't slide around too much, and i would still feel comfortable using this bag with the sg. the padding is aproximently an inch think all around and top and bottom, and the zippers are of good quality.
