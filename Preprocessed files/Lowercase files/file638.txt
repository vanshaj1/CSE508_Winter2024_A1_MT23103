first of all, i am a huge fender fan. guitars, amps and especially their pickups.  second, when it comes to tone, i am very picky. i love the fender custom shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and fat 50s. i wanted to try something other than fender this time, so i chose these ssl-1s. so far i think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup i have ever had. big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  on a lot of pickups in strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  these strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  some other vintage single coils ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these ssl-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  very nice and yes i would buy them again.
