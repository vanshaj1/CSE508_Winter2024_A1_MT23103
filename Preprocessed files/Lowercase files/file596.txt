i now have eight of these.  i enjoy seeing my instruments, and feel confident they are safely off the floor away from little monsters.  i didn't understand they came in different woods so they don't all match.  no matter, they still work well.  i wasn't real sure about the mounting screws that came with them.  however, they have been up a couple of years and no problem at all.  note, i am not hanging mandolins which are a bit heavier.  i have tenor and soprano ukuleles.  second note: the cushioned part that holds the instrument comes in different sizes, the narrow size is the one you need for thru tuners.
