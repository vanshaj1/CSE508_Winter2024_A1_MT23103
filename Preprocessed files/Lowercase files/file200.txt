i ordered eight of these after reading the reviews.  i have five guitars, including two les paul's and they hold them just fine.  i give them four stars.  the are fine for, i believe, all guitars at home, but i wouldn't use them for retail or something like a school.  they are made if abs plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it's just a rivet the holds them together.  the wall anchors that they send with them are a joke.  like the other reviewer said, you really should find a stud to mount them to, but if you must use wall anchors, use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall.  all in all these are sturdy and stable (when anchored to a stud) and i'll use more if i have the need.
