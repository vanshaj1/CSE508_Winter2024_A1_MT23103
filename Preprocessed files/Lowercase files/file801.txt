i got this to replace the bridge pickup on my squire strat. i was skeptical that it would really make much difference, but my feedback problem was solved, and the tone is much warmer and cleaner (the old pickup was just awful). i read comments saying that the green wire goes with the red and the white is hot. mine came with the red wire as hot, and i didn't change that. it works, and it definitely sounds like a beige pickup is supposed to, so it think you should just trust whatever setup the factory gives you. also, i know other people explained this, but many said they had to enlarge the pickup hole to accommodate the pickup. you do not. it takes a bit of patience but if you are careful, you can slip it in with no modifications.if you are looking to upgrade a cheap guitar, you should be pretty well satisfied with this pickup.

p.s. this is the first thing i ever soldered, and i suck at everything. if you are thinking about changing a pickup but don't think you can do it right, anything i can do, you can do better.
