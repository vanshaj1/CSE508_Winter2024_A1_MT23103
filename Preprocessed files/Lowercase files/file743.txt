these guitar straps are downright luxurious. so comfortable and absolutely beautiful. i have two beautiful dixon hummingbirds, and these are the only straps that are just as beautiful as my guitars. i loved the first one i bought so much that i bought two more. i put one on on my pretty schecter siii custom electric guitar as well. they are really well made. i have not seen better quality on another strap i've owned.
