i gave a cheaper neck a shot. i am blown away by the look of this neck. the stain used is just enough to highlight the grain nicely and the clear coat is darn near perfect. i figured a lot of time would be during the "adjustment" phase of the build. nothing else had to be done once the neck was set and bolted on. what a pleasant surprise since in past builds i'd spent an hour or more getting them set. i've used fender and warmoth before that cost 3 times and more than this one. the proof had been in the pudding though. this neck has been on this guitar for over a year now. no problems. i use this guitar as a back up and play it quite frequently on gigs. i buy more!
