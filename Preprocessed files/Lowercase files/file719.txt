purchased after studying the reviews on quality, which is accurate for this mount. it timely arrived. the center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the atr 2100, that i own. the 2100 indicates 51mm, but that is at the mike area, not the trunk which is much smaller and used for mounting to the shock mount. after researching a replacement in the same price range, i found none. i had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. this is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  i cut the foam about 4" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. it fits perfect. i didn't seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. i now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, i purchase a larger microphone. i have attached a photo. after the image was created, i further trimmed the foam length to match the actual size of the mounting holder opening.  this shock mount is a quality product at a great price.
