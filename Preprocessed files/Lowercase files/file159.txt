overall, this neck is a good deal. it's straight, level and the wood has nice grain. everything seems to intonate correctly. it fit my vm squire telecaster neck pocket perfectly. i had to file 7 frets to level it, but i guessed that going in.
my neck is kind of chunky with a 12" radius. it's a bit more "d" shape than the stock neck.
finish work is what's to be expected at this price point. its coated in a thin layer of pale satin poly. heel end and 22nd fret lip are rough. contour around truss adjust was so crooked i had to measure nut slot to make sure it wasn't the real problem. frets are not very tall and on the soft side.
if i were in a pinch, i would order this again. id have no problem recommending to thrifty guitarists.
