simple, cost effective, no frills design that gets the job done. hardly worth noting, but there are no mounting instructions. it should be intuitive, however.

the parts line up flush and even. the wood is smooth. the arms simply screw into the plate and wood screws go into two designated holes. the hardware included should be more than enough to hang whatever you intend.
