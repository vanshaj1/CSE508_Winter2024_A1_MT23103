i bought this for my monoprice les paul copy, as it doesn't come with a pickup selector plate or pickguard. i'm happy with the color and quality, it came with a bunch of screws and a pick. i didn't need the backplates, but they are the right size. for the price i'm happy, as the pickguard alone can run anywhere from $10-20.
