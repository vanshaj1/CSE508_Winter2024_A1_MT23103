never levelled frets before i picked this thing up. the concept seemed simple enough. i figured that, due to the weight of this block, little to no pressure would be required and that was a good call.

this thing did wonders for an old 93 korean squier that had some buzzing issues after a normal setup. in just a couple of minutes it was quite apparent that the frets had all been perfectly levelled with the greatest ease. all that was left was to recrown the frets with another nifty tool i picked up from amazon and i now have the most incredible sustain from a $40 guitar that rivals some of it's american counterparts. all this in about 20 mins. cant wait to work on some more frets now. great product, bernie.
