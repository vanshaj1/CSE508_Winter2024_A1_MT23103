does everything i need it to do, gets the instrument out of the way, on but not against the wall and in a good place to be seen. this works even if you don't have a stud where you want to put it, i just nail it to the wall, the white plastic things they included looked like they might make some big holes. it also looks good when the instrument isn't hanging on it. i have 3 now, they take about 4 or 5 days to arrive.
