i put these knobs on my squire strat, my epi sg, and an off brand strat. they all fit easily enough (a bit snug but i prefer that). they are very heavy and solid feeling. ive had them on the guitar pictured since i got them a few months ago and i haven't had any problems. i did kind of dent the inside of a gold one as i put it on my squire, so you do have to be careful when installing. also, as people have said, the black knobs have no hole in the chin to tighten or loosen. as far as i can tell, this is about the best value you can get for these style knobs, and i do not think you will be disappointed with them.
