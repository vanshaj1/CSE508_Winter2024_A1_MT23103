let me start of by saying that this is my first new drum set in 10 years, and it totally rocks,it is a great sounding set! (wouldn't hurt to upgrade heads and cymbals) but the current ones will hold over, until i can get upgrades other than that i am very happy with this set it is an excellent upgrade from my old one and comes through 100% best purchase made! (silver snare drum is my own) not to confuse it with the set.
