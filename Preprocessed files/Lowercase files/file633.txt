what luck that i received dad's mandolin back from the luthier at the same time i was offered a trial of this mandolin strap in the vine program!

it's nothing fancy - pretty much a strip of black leather about 3/4" wide - but mandolin players tend to be less visually flashy than, say, guitar or banjo players!

there are several holes on one end designed to fit over the button, then a tie on the other end to connect to the scroll.

i like it!
