i use cs robert cray set in one guitar...that tone. these '59 set are equal in tone heaven. tried 57/62 set...not enough subtle chime and throaty sound, too much hammer thud. i've owned a '63 vintage stratocaster , back in the early 70's when they were $250-$300...these pickups give me
what i got spoiled on. forget fat 50's~texas specials, unless you enjoy mud coming out of your speakers. i like hearing guitar, not a floor full of pedals that produce kazoo sounds in the end......i'm 66...i know tone when i hear it...with these ...i hear it..
go buy them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
