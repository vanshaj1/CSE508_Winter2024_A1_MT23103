1 spot pro cs 12 handled all heavy lifting power requirements (strymon blue sky, eventide timefactor, digtech whammy (v4 or v5) .
it has nice feature, the 18vdc positions can be converted to 9vdc using truetone v189 converter, this capability will increase my power ports from 9 to 11. easy mounting under pedaltrain novo 32, hardware included.

issues stated by robert's review. i did not have any issues with either, 1) attaching mounting brackets onto the cs12 p/s, as holes were tapped. 2) self drilling screws worked flawlessly to mount the cs12 p/s onto a pedaltrain novo 32.

the partial plugged power jacks are my fault at time of taking picture, not a product defect.
