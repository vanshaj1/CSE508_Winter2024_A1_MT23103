very happy with this baritone ukulele. i have been wanting to try one since i also play guitar. there was a little buzzing but raising the bridge a tiny bit solved the problem. also upgraded the tuners just because i had some nice silver ones on hand. .  the sound on this uke is wonderful. can't go wrong with this beauty.
