these picks not only look good the are comfortable to use. the seem to have a rounded valley which leaves a raised edged. this helps to keep your finger on the pick and doesn't allow it to move around. in the close up picture you can see a slight curvature. this is the first time i have used these picks. i don't know how they will last but i will have fun finding out. it's a pick. you use it on a guitar. it's not complicated. i think its a very personal choice. but i have really enjoyed using these so far.
