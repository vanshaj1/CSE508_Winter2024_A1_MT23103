i've used this for 3 years every halloween and it always has worked well for me.  after each use, i rinse the tank out with distilled water, then run the unit until just steam comes out, then i dump the water and store the unit dry.  i've heard of people who think you should store the units full of fog juice, but i've heard of people who say the pump gets gunky if you do that.
