perfect fit on my epiphone lp 100.... my beginner guitar.  had to decide if i wanted to sell my lp-100 after upgrading to an lp standard.  decided to keep lp 100 for sentimental reasons but wanted to get rid of cream colored trim.  swapped out cream colored pick-up trim and the poker chip for black ....love it
