easy as heck to put on, in my opinion better than sperzel. these took literally 10 minutes to put on my  mim strat.
only thing ill say is you will probably need a setup after as removing these tuners, you can remove any string guides or trees from your headstock and that is  going to change the angle of your bridge a little bit. so be aware.
