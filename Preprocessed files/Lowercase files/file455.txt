great replacement. 3 ply and made very well. as good as the fender parts. note: this is for the made in mexico (mim) or fender american standard stratocaster. please read all the specs on the website description. see a lot of people complaining it doesn't fit their strat. well it's because it wasn't made for their model. this will not fit a squier or roadhouse, deluxe. do your homework and you won't land up with the wrong pickguard.
