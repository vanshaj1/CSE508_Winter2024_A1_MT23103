this microphone is durable, loud, and clear. i got this to improve the sound of the blowing up podcast and it did wonders for cutting back on noise.  i've also used it for live sound and actually like it more than my sm-58.  it also looks and feels very nice, if you care about that.

it comes with a nice case and a mic clip. there's no on/off switch, which makes it less likely to break. it doesn't come with a cord because it's a serious piece of usual equipment. you'll need an xlr cable.
