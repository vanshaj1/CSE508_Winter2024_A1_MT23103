it would be easy to blame the guitar but some of my fellow musians have tried it with there guitar ans same thing.. most pro-nounced on the highest strings.. all the strings have the same volume or dynamics. whether i play my 335 or my southwestern. acoustic. this is important to me as i busk solo.
  now the good news, nothing else to complane about, maybe battery lifr.  i also own the street cube with two speakers,umpteen effects.battery lasts about 3 times long.
  piezo's are finicky. i am glad i bought this because on a whim, i can go to the beach and with the sound of the ocean covering my complain it sounds great. on a whim, i uphostered the cube with leapord skin thick cloth.. sure does get many compliments on  which gives me a break from playing!
