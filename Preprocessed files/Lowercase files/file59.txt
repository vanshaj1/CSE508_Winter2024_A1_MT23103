i actually picked up this bass at my local guitar center used, for $60! i brought it home, wiped it down with some dunlop guitar polish, cleaned and treated the fretboard with lemon oil, and put on a d'addario light set of strings. i have $75 invested, and it plays amazing! i've played it through numerous cabs, and record with it. very happy. check through the used section at gc first if you don't mind a quick cleaning and restring to save you $125!
