my oldest son and husband are avid guitar players. we have close to 20 guitars in our home both acoustic and electric. since my son began playing guitar he has gone through at least 6 capo's. it had become a joke in our family whenever we drove past guitar center we would ask our son if he needed a new capo.

this donner capo has held up the longest of any capo i have purchased him and it's still working. the clamping mechanism is strong and has not popped apart like all of our previous capo's.

i do not play guitar, however my son and husband tell me this is a very well made capo and that it does exactly what it's supposed to do.

i personally am happy i haven't had to buy a capo since purchasing this one!

i was given this capo at a discounted price for an honest review. all opinions and photo's are my own. thank you!
