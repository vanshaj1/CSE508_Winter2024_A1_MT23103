monster grips are a necessity for guitarists and bassists who demand that their pick has a grippy surface! they adhesive on them is very strong and will stick to picksp made of any material. i use them on carbon fiber picks, bone picks, brass pics & horn picks.  i've discovered that they are also handy for other things as well such as pictures and frames on my wall. one monster grip on the back corners of the picture frame will keep them from sliding crooked on the wall!
