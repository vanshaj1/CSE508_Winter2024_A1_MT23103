i diid an "all fender, all over" (as much as practical) upgrade to a $190 gfs xaviere "tele".  it came exceptionally well packaged an absolutely no flaws. unlike the cover that came with the guitar, this one is non magnetic, which is a good thing. the gfs guitar is mostly vintage specs and this cover fit perfectly. makes me wonder if some of the other reviewers got knock offs. i always buy original manufacturer stuff when doing a hardware upgrade, especially if it's only a few bucks more. i've had my fill of trying to fit crappy, cheap, import stuff. don't get me wrong, there is some really good import stuff out there, but you really have to know what to look for and do your homework.
