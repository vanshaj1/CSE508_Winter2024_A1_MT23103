this pop filter works perfect and i like that it's easily adjustable. the images show a all black pop filter but i received a white and pink/purple filter. that's the only reason i'm going to give it 3 starts. isn't a little strange and everyone always comments on that fact. it kind of throws off the vibe of my booth. i'll be purchasing anyone some time in the future from a different company most likely because i want a black one. image attached.
