these cables are perfect for pedalboards that need a little more reach than average. they aren't as cheap looking as other budget cables.

admittedly i'm not a cable snob, but i don't care for crap cables either. these are about the same quality as the fender cables you see in the fishbowls of the big-brother music stores. one thing to keep in mind, if you mount your cables into a pedalboard and use zip ties, the cables don't move much and are less prone to breakage like your regular guitar cables. the diy kits by george l and planet waves are ridiculously priced, and these are a great alternative.
