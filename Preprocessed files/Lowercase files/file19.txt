i bought this item because it had good reviews and it was cost effective compared to the top name brands. so far i have only used this item in a practice setting, but it does exactly as it states. i have noticed if the product is left on for several hours it gets a little warm, but it doesn't seem to be any sort of issue

12v and 18v out allows for easy hookup into those oddball pedals (just make sure you don't plug your 9v pedal into one of those slots).

i would recommend this item to anybody compiling their first pedal board. i know you can just pop a 9v battery in most pedals and away you go, but...

running the cost comparison of this power supply to 9v batteries makes it pretty obvious that this power supply is worth every penny. plus you never have to worry about a dead battery in your loop ruining a gig.
