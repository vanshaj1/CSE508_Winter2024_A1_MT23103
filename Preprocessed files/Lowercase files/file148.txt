this tenor ukulele case is great. love the color (red) as well as the burgandy colored padded interior. this case is very sturdy and well made. all four latches close securely. there is an extra piece of removable padding on the inside that i placed along the side of my ukulele for a very nice, snug fit. i was looking for a hard case that had a pair of backpack straps, which this model does. i don't know if all the colors have that, but i was told that the red, white and champagne colored cases have the removable backpack straps. the straps are also nicely padded. really if there was anything i would find fault with is that it is a rather heavy case, being fiberglass. but that's a price i'm happy to pay for the bombproof security this case affords my expensive pono ukulele.
