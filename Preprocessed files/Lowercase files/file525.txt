i love those guitar picks, and they last for a long time too (more likely to lose them).
the xl and standard jazz iii guitar picks are both my favorite.
i have included few photos for you to look at the details of the product.
there are few common dunlop guitar picks for you to look at.
the xl size is good for people with larger hands, i personally prefer standard sized one.
overall, i am very happy with this purchase, so i give it five stars.
