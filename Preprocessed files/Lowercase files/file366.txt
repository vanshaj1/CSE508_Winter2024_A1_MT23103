overall i'm happy with the stand.  i admit i was scratching my head a bit when i was putting it together.  there's more pieces to this stand than others i've had.  adjusting it is a little bit of a pain because there are 4 different areas that you can loosen and change around.  if you travel and gig a lot, you may want to go with the higher model, the adjustments look a bit easier.  however once all setup, it's sturdy and well built.

fyi the stand shown currently is not the same design as the one i received.  i uploaded a picture of the one i received from this order page which has a separate arm piece that inserts into the main stand.
