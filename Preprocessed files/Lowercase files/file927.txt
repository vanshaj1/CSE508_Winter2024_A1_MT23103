this was an ebay buy to flip. not a bad bass guitar. just not worth much, used or new. the bridge pickup is very noisy. the pickups are not an active pickup. if they were an active pickup without the boom sound, then i would say its a 4 star. everything is about the same as the gsr200 as far as body, neck, and bridge. mine was a $79 buy new and a $119 flip. its an ok bass guitar after a string change and a setup. this is more of a first time bass buyer who is learning to play.
