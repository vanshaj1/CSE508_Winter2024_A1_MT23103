guys, this is a really good sounding pedal.  it has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  the sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  this is not a super scooped metal pedal.  it's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  the big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like heat.  i had a gig in detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree plus day.  the pedal didn't like it at all.  my boss blues driver was just fine.  of course the blues driver is a $100 pedal. it took the temps just fine. so, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with joyo vs other, more expensive, pedals.  keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. so, rock on and enjoy your music!!
