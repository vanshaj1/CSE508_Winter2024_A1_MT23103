i'm using several of these on a wall i built. the hangers work great with several different head-stock shapes. i wish there were available bands, straps or locking devices to keep instruments secure here in earthquake prone california. i ended up using velcro strips under the hangers that affix over the fretboard. otherwise a great hanger..
