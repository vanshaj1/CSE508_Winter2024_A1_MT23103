we used this one in the middle as seen in the picture holding the white guitar. big mistake! the guitar almost was destroyed. this is not strong enough to hold a 7 string schecter omen guitar. while it worked out and seemed secure at first. literally 7 days later the guitar had almost fell to the floor. i wouldn't recommend this for heavier guitars. instead we will be keeping the guitar in the stand where it is safer.
