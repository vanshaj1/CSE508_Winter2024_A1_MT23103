this is an excellent little stand.  the adjustment for angle is easy to do, and the construction is robust. quite roadworthy!  it fits my mesa-boogie subway rocket perfectly, and holds it at just the right angle to make the most of my little amp.  the boogie is no lightweight either. it is a handbuilt, all tube point-to-point american-made amp in a robust case.
