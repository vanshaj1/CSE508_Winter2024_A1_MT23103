great little mouthpiece sleeve that fits my otto link hard rubber tenor sax mouthpiece near-perfectly!

glad to offer my mouthpiece a bit of protection in my case and on the go. it's nothing overly substantial, no thick padding or the likes. but it's great for keeping track of your mouthpiece outside of the case and on to go. if you're looking for a cheap worthwhile case, this is it.
