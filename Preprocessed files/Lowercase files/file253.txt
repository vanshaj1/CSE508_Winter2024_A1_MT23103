judging from the reviews, the quality must be variable, but this one was a quick bolt-on. the neck was straight and even had the correct relief; frets were smooth and will require only minimum hand rolling of the ends. this one had the correct strat heel shape.  it is a beautiful fretboard with lots of character; the inexpensive nut was the right height and easy enough to replace.  i was able to brand it with my logo, give it a few coats of tung oil and put it on a handmade custom ordered offset guitar that i just finished in my workshop. i've ordered another.
