i bought this last week from another retailer. this is the best case i have ever purchased, but it's heavy as hell! i wasn't expecting it to be 150lbs empty.

the table is extremely sturdy. folds out easy. the table can be reversed to either side. casters are solid as a rock, so solid if you get this thing past 5mph and hit a rock, this thing may flip. try not to keep it top heavy. only con i can think is, it's a pain to flip back up if you lay it down. i laid it down to install equipment,i couldn't pick it back up no matter what i tried. you're gonna love this thing
