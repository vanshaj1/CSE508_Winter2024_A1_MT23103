i was really looking forward to using this keyboard due to it having all of the features that i needed at it's particular price point. when i opened it up, it didn't even come in it's own box. it's box was just the shipping box. immediately after taking it out of the box, i heard this rattle as if something was loose inside and it fell through the entire keyboard  like a rain stick. i checked out all of the keys individually and they all worked except for a c# on the lowest octave.

i don't know if it was the fault of nektar,  audiodeluxe or ups but i just can't really recommend this keyboard the way i had received it.
