i had been looking to buy another bass since i'm working in the middle east and don't have access to my other basses in the states. the musicman ray34 bass was being considered because of the price and the reviews. i've been playing bass for over 40 years and had never even picked up a music man bass before. i ordered one that had been returned so it was sold as used, it was sent through the apo mail system (which i really appreciate with amazon), but could not find a mark or smudge on it.  it was as new as it could be. much to my surprise, it was also "in tune". it was setup perfectly. i have played it here for a couple of months with some friends and they are amazed on how good it sounds. i have always been a fender man but this is now my favorite bass. thanks again for supporting the military apo/fpo mail system.
