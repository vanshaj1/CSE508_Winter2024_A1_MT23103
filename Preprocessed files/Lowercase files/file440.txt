now all i have to do is install these on my burswood strat copy. i know i'm gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins i may even have to drill the tuner holes also. look forward to getting those crappy, loose, un-smooth, original hardware tuners off this thing.

  just installed these fender locking tuners on my strat. didn't have to drill the tuner holes, they were the perfect size. placed all the tuners in the headstock lined them up with a straight edge and just pressed each tuner very firmly into their hole (with the locking part screwed in tight so as not to damage them) and  very lightly and carefully tapped them with a small rubber mallet to mark my drill points. then with a small magnifying glass and using a punch i made a center punch mark (just using pressure by hand with the punch since wood is soft) on each indent that the tuner made. set my drill depth with a piece of tape on the drill and was done in less than 15 minutes.
