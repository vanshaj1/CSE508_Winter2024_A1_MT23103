i like this pedal very much so far. my favorite pedal was a joyo and it didn't last long. it's in my junk pile. i hate the for the money thing. this delay pedal does a lot more than most one trick ponys out there. money when you get into chinese stuff is a gamble, i hope i get some time out of this joyo because it just that great.
