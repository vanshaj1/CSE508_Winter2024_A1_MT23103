the neck had the most amazing finish.

however, the edge of the neck above the 22nd fret was not finished (rough and bare un-sanded wood). did not look like the photos at all or any other 22 fret stratocaster necks. also the frets stuck out of the sides of the neck which could easily fixed with a 35 degree fret beveling file and then polishing. also there was a saw cut that went below the notch for the nut about 1/8and inch. which is just poor quality workmanship. the unfinished and un-beveled end of the neck above the 22nd fret and the notch for the nut were just not acceptable. returned the item and bought another two. let's see how they do the second and third time around and i will update this post.

they need to have a better quality process.

update: second neck arrived of equally poor quality. spend more money and go somewhere else.
