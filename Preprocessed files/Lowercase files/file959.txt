this is not a sturdy stand. this is probably not suitable for a school band room. it is a lightweight, foldable and easily stashed stand that barely holds a three ring binder with 50 pages of fake tab. but it does manage to do this. that's all i wanted. i can keep it folded up and out of the way next to the couch and take it out when i need it. hands down beats the previous music stand i was using: the floor.
