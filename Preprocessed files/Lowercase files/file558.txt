adds a nice touch of originality. i paired these with a fender tweed strap, but maybe it is a little bit of overkill having the f sign everywhere ("ok ok we know it is a fender, come on!"). they are kind of massive when installed, doesn't look bad but just bulky. only problem i had is that i had previously installed a set of dunlop straplocks, and when substituting them for these, the new fender screw fell kind of short, and never got tight, they always stayed turning around when screwing them. so i had to use the previous dunlop screws with the new fender ones, and it worked like a charm. not a problem of the product, but if one has used something else before, one might have these kinds of issues later. not as easy to lock into the guitar as other models, this one requires two fingers to adjust, instead of for instance dunlops, with just a central button. just be sure that your guitar is strapped when you let it go!
