squier vintage modified jazz bass.

if your reading this you already know all the major features so i won't dig into that.
this is an outstanding bass for the price...and even if it had a larger price tag it would still be an excellent choice.  the quality is excellent , it has great pickups and it sounds just as good as my fender custom shop jazz.
don't be fooled by the price,  you don't need to spend this month's rent on a bass to get an excellent instrument that is well beyond expectations.  add a gator hard shell case and you have a super sweet jazz bass.
-excellent overall quality
-excellent fit and finish
-no sharp fret edges
-great stock duncan designed pickups ..excellent
-killer bass at twice the price
highly recomended. you will only note one major difference if you audition the squire jazz and the fender jazz side by side. ...the decal.
