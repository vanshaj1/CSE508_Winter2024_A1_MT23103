fits my at2035 like a glove. it does cover the entire grill (see picture), just took a little careful finagling to get it on. as some reviewers have said, it does come in a little baggy pressed flat. mine has expanded nicely in just an afternoon. doubt if there's much better for my mic at the same price. highly recommend.
