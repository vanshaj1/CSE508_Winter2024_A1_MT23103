it's may best solid state amps i ever had. very versatile just one cons i can tell be aware when or need to use external pedals need optimization for work as you intended. it's very tricky (remember it's a modeler amp take this in consideration). but for a stan-alone application it's the best. have anything you'll need. just connect your guitar and start playing as that easy.
