it's great bass rosin. i have tried pop's, nyman, and kolstein. i like pop's and kolstein the best. pop's (when fresh) is the stickiest. nyman is hard and powdery. kolstein is very sticky and there is almost no powder at all. there is something special in their formulation. i believe kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. the other benefit of kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. some people will only use pop's for a few months before throwing it away. i go back and forth between kolstein and pop's. i still can't decide which is my favorite. but them both and try it out.
