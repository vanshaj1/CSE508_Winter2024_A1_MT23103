my les paul guitar fits nicely in this gig bag, so does my stratocaster, it has 3 large zip up storage compartments for picks, tuners, sheet music, cords, strings, and more. its nicely made and is rather protective for the guitar, the material isn't really soft so beware guitar scratches, but this gig bag is very nice, i'd recommend it to anyone needing a good quality gig bag.
