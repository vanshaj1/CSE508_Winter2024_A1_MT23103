worked ok in a pinch as a last minute purchase.  all of my amp rack patch panels have neutrik nl4mp connectors, as most of my speakers.  i have some monitors with 1/4" inputs which i am swapping out with neutrik nl4mps.  so no more 1/4"inputs and no more knock offs for me.  no i will not purchase this product again. (photo shows 'my custom made' 12/4 cable connected to oem cable connector and panel mount).
