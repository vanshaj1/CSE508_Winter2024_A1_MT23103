i am impressed with this pedal. it works quite well, especially with a guitar ran through it for key reference. we have used it for many different applications, and different styles, and it seems to work under most conditions. i really enjoy the variation you have at your disposal with this pedals settings. you can have 1 or 2 lines of harmony, and you can chose whether they are each higher or lower, and between a 3rd and a 5th or the root note. the ability to control those factors makes a world of difference. i would recommend checking out some of the demo review videos if you are interested in this pedal.
