line 6 relay g10 is very awesome. i had been in the market for quite some time when i saw this being advertised. my friends have other systems and they all have a chord leading to a small pack they wear on their hip. i didn't want the added "baggage' to carry as i also have in ear monitors that have said "baggage". this thing performs through my entire house and on stage. it's a wonderful edition to my gear most definitely charge plug and play. you will not regret it!
