i love this guitar. you can have a clean tone or a crunch tone which is perfect for what i play. it was my first bass and i got it at a local used gear shop. i have had it for a little over a year and it has been through a lot. it sounds great and it is really durable and can go through a lot. i have played this bass every where i have played
