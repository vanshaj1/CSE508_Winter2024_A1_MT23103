great item, i installed it with no problems, i ordered together with the shure a26x 3 inch extension,following the recommendations of one reviewer here on amazon, i'm glad i did, my keyboard it's the yamaha psr s900, which has built in speakers and makes the keyboard "thicker/higher" than a regular keyboard so the extension it's definitely needed. i also order the onstage boom stand arm, everything works great i also ordered[to arrive thursday] the quick clip extension just to make it easier to remove.
