my use for a guitar stand is primarily so my guitar actually gets played instead of sitting in it's case.  i love this stand!  it is stable and the pitch on it isn't so great for my martin dc-15e that it takes up a lot of space.  i like that it doesn't have the higher piece that sits on the neck so it doubles as a decorative piece.  i couldn't be happier!
