i play guitar with a flat pick. but i also play ukulele, and hard picks can make the uke sound a little harsh. i've tried felt uke picks, but they never felt comfortable. so i use one of these alaska pik fingerpicks over my index finger for strumming. size is important. i have medium sized hands, and these picks can slip off my fingertip when it's hot and muggy, like when i'm playing at an outdoor market. that can cause some awkwardness when trying to strum, sing and keep the pick from flying off my finger. i might try the next size smaller in the future. but this is the best pick i've found for getting a loud, round sound out of my uke.
