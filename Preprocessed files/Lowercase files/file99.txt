great cable for the money.  the 90 degree connectors are excellent to minimize the strain on acoustic guitar jacks.

***edit***
i have changed this rating from 5 stars to 2. the 90 degree connectors are poorly built. they are pressed together and easily break apart. i believe the connection on the 90 degree end is also the culprit for occasional noise. the straight ends seem to hold up well though.
