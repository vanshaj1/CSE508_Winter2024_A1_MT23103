this is nominally a violin/viola stand, but due to the length and neck diameter, also works well as a mandolin stand. my paris swing mandolin fits nicely into the auto grip holder. an added bonus is that my irish bodhran (18" frame drum) rests comfortably on top of the auto grip assembly, with the bottom of the rim resting against the padded legs as does the body of a stringed instrument.

the construction and ruggedness of the hercules stand is great, and this particular model comes with a carrying bag.

in all, a great value.
