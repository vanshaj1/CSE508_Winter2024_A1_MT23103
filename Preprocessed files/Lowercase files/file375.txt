great, lightweight product that easily replaces some of my older lighting that's nearly eight times the size and weight.  having two synced with a dmx cable easily fills the room.  the extra colors not available in many of the big name lights is great addition (orange, purple and white).  only time will tell how reliable they are.  i'm not a big fan of the white house (which glows), but aside from that, they're perfect.

as for my background, i'm a professional dj with 15 years of experience.  i replaced a couple of chauvet lights with these.  the kinta x and the derby x.  these are better.
