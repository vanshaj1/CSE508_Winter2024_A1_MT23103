great quality patch cables!

i wanted something other than those cheap blue, green, red and yellow patch cables because i didn't want to replace the cables on my pedal board several times a year.

i purchased these because they had excellent reviews and i'd like to add to those because they are great cables, well built, feel sturdy and have a great quality feel. i get great tones from my pedals and amp and they were the perfect link for me. if you're on the fence about the hosa cpe-118, go for it, you will be happy with them!
