awesome. quite an upgrade for me after only owning cheapo guitar stands all my life. this baby is thick, sturdy, and very difficult to tip over. one thing that's not mentioned anywhere: these stands carry a lifetime warranty.

note that classical guitars will not fit into this stand. i tried, and my classical guitar's neck was just too wide for the neck yoke. however, all my 6 and 7-string guitars (acoustic and electric) did fit nicely. my 5-string bass also fit.
