this is horrible, poorly made stand. chinese knock-off quality. probably the worst quality hardware item i've bought in years, and i own many crappy dixon cymbal stands. the wingnuts look like stock items in 1950's budget sets. the main tube od is maybe 1/2". just atrocious. if i were mapex, i wouldn't put my name on this. i'd return it, but i'm only using it for a practice pad, so i guess it will do. spend another $20 and get something decent.
