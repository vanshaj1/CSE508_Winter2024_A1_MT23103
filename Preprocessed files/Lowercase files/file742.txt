ordered a "mugig" tuner, but received one with a "musedo" brand mark. (see photo) who is "musedo", anyway?! i'm sure i'm correct in my assumption that these inexpensive tuners are mass-produced in china and receive all manner of brand name logos on them.

also, due to package being labeled "lithium battery enclosed", this amazon prime item took 7 full days to arrive... not the usual 2-day prime shipping.

aside from these two issues, this $9 tuner seems to work as well as my $20 korg tm50bk.
i purchased it because the price was so low that i thought it couldn't hurt to have an extra tuner lying about the studio.
i plan to order another to donate to our church's music dept.

for those interested, this tuner w/included clip-on mic does indeed fit in the same co2crea case made for the korg tm50bk tuner:

nice little tuner at a nice little price.
