perfect fit on my 2016 gibson les paul studio faded.  i didn't like the original speed knobs because they were too big and clunky-feeling. i was skeptical about these knobs after reading some reviews about poor quality, but i think they're very high quality.  the finish is perfect on them:  no seams, scratches, chips, etc.  i don't know what more someone could expect quality-wise.

they also sit much closer to the body than the old speed knobs, so it's a cleaner look.

i truly can't imagine why anyone would have any problem with these whatsoever if they're ordering for a usa-made gibson.  i don't think these will fit so well on an epiphone though.
