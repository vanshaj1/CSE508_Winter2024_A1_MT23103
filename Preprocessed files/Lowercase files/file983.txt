the harp i got was a 5 inch 12 hole c key harp  not the 4 inch 10 hole harp that was pictured.  this harp will not fit in the small harp holder so i had to borrow someone's holder at the last gig.  since i used the harp i am not going to return it but i'm not happy that i have to buy the harp again - the correct harp.  the harp they send me was a good harp but not what i wanted.
