i've tried several other "cheaper" tuners and this is the one that is highly accurate. i even had them all connected at once and this one got the most precise readings. it's good for 6 string guitars but 7-8 strings may have more problems. the design is nice and the color is beautiful. it feels quite fragile since it's plastic so you have to be careful with it but it's cheap enough to replace without worry. nice to have if you don't have a line in through tuner like the korg pitch black.
