i do wish some reviewers would do a little basic research into what they are buying before posting negative comments. this neck plate is a high quality replacement for the plate that comes standard on newly-manufactured us strats (and probably teles). i purchased this to update the look of my '97 "weird, fat logo" neck plate and am very pleased with the results. the material appears to be aluminum or aluminum alloy with a chrome finish, in contrast to the heavier steel that it replaced. i did not bust out the calipers but it is at least as thick as the older version. it is not plastic, nor pot metal. it comes with screws. for giggles, i stopped by guitar center after installing it and yep...all american standard strats have this exact same neck plate.
