i do like these strings! are they the best? there are so many personal preferences. have you ever asked a drummer what double bass drum pedal they like? it is all too subjective, but i can tell you i have so far liked the quality and feel of the super slinky pink!
it can never hurt to try a few and see what works best for you!

05/25/2017-still playing this same set of strings on the lp, and they still sound great!

after a couple of hours of playing one of my acoustics, i am ready for a break. the super slinky's feel so soft and comfortable. i could play them all day!

i am getting ready to through on a set on the new tele!
