i've been playing for 9 years and was worried this won't be on par with the mid-end guitar i've been using. the guitar both looks and feels great. the finish is very well done. it's got a warm and full sound to it that i really enjoyed, that at times i found myself reluctant to stop playing. and i was really pleased with how smooth the fretting was, it felt like it took less effort to move between the frets and press down than on several guitars i've played on previously.

the only gripe i have is that the fret position markers (dots) are really dark and hard to spot (see pictures). but that's not a deal breaker by any means, since when playing you would normally look at the markers on the side of the neck, which were pretty clear. still, aesthetically the dark markers don't look as nice.

but overall i was quite impressed, especially for such a great price. you know a guitar is good when it encourages you to play more often again, and makes it hard to stop and put it down.
