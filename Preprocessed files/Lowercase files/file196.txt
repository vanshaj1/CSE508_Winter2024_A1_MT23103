these go wonderfully with my zakk wylde les paul custom plus grail. been using dunlop straploks for years. they definitely take a beating. granted i am not doing around the worlds and jumping around stage like a coke head, that behavior will destroy nearly any product, especially with wood and small screws. however, they definitely withstand some metal stage presence. had some issues with seating but hats user error. push the button and ensure it is fully seated and protect your guitar and investment. easy day.
