we opened the case and immediately saw the bow had strings visibly hanging off of it.  when we turned the latch to remove the bow to inspect it, we could see that several strings were caught in the the latch.  it took several minutes to carefully extracate it from the latch without breaking even more strings. not sure if this was previously used and returned as new or just carelessly packed.  we haven't tuned it yet and will update our review on the actual violin later.  at this point, i am concerned.
*****no bridge included with the violin.
