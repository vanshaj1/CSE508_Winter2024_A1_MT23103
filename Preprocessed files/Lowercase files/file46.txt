i have a 1950s fender tweed amp, so i wanted to get this strap to match it. it is a perfect match! the leather on the ends is a bit lighter than in the product picture, but it's fine. i love that the stripe is fender tweed, which any musician should recognize. it's not garish -- it's a subtle statement. the feel of the fabric is nice, and it isn't too stiff like some straps are. all in all, it was a good purchase.
