just installed my new pick guard and trem cover.  looks great and fits perfectly on my squier classic vibe strat.  the only problem is that a classic vibe strat comes with an 8-hole pick guard, and this one has 11 holes.  good thing is that the 8 existing holes lined up with 8 holes in the pick guard, and i had to drill the remaining three holes.  but since the pick guard was installed already i knew exactly where to drill them.

my classic vibe guitar came with a bright-white, thick, single-ply pick guard.  it was really kind of ugly and cheap looking, but with the new one it's a lot easier on the eyes.

highly recommended.  i've tried other musiclily products and so far have never had any problems with quality or fitment.
