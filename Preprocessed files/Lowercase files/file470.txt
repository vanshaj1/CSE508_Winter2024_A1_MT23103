i have purchased 7 donner guitar pedals recently  and i like the price of these pedals as well as the sounds quality of them. on several pedals the true bypass switch is loose and on another  pedal the same switch is slightly stiff. due to the small size of these pedal, i was able to put 11 pedals total on a 12in12in plant caddy after removing the wheels.
