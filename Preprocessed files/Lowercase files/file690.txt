blends beautifully with the chrome tonearm, and includes the 4g weight which is easily removed.  i am using in conjunction with an ortofon 2m red on a 1200mk2.  excellent results.  somehow, although the output level is rated the same between my previous setup (concorde cartridge with ortofon night club stylus, 5mv spec), i am now getting a proper output level through my preamp, whereas the previous cartridge/stylus was at at least 6db lower.  weird.  tried two different model stylii on the other headshell, another headshell altogether, and they both gave the same result.
