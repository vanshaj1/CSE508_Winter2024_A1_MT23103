i played a wedding today using the alaska picks on my thumb and ring finger.  they were very comfortable and stayed on my finger well without being to tight.  for my fingers i cut the extra piece off and just used the smaller part.  it fits snug under my nail and is the perfect length. for my thumb i used the full size of the pick and it worked great.  the material is easy to bend and shape using a file and buffing blocks.  this produces a naturally smooth sound that you can get with your nails.  i got the medium size. they fit great on all my fingers but i might try the larger version for my thumb but the medium works great if you bend the plastic back and it makes it looser around the thumb.
