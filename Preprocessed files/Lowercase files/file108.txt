i have been using these dr flatwound bass strings with a great deal of amazement.  i have installed these strings on two of my basses and i find them to be most excellent for my needs.  for one thing, these kind of strings are not "fret eaters" due to their flatwound smooth surface.  also, they are lots easier on your fingers if you should play that way.  the various tones and behaviors that these strings produce is hard to describe, but it is a situation that very much agrees with me.  you almost have to hear them to really know.  i just got done installing a set of these dr's on a reverend thundergun 4 string bass and they sound awesome.  it might be noted that this bass has a 34" scale neck and string through bridge.  i had no problems with installation or in tuning.  i am pretty much committed to these style of bass strings.  however a word of caution here.  these strings are not supposed to fit long scaled necks.  i shall conclude this review with 6 pictures.  5 stars on these strings for dang sure :)
