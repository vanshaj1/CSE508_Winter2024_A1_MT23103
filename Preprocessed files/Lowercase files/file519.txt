i love this guitar! i honestly never held a squire brand strat before, but compared to everything i've held, played, and heard in the past; this guitar really gives you the best bang for your buck. especially if you're like me and pretty much poor as dirt. i thought that with this guitar being so cheap i'd probably want to get some small upgrades, but i'm pretty content with what i got after the first 10 minutes of playing.

i recommend this guitar to pretty much anyone that wants a strat of incredible quality and price.
