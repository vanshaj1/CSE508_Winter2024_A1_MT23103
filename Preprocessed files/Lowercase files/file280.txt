this is my second ukulele. i recieved this as a christmas gift and i love it. it has very nice strings and has like mother of pearl tuning pegs. with my first uke i had trouble with the strings being hard to tune but right when i got this i tuned within 30 seconds and started playing. also it comes with a chord chart and songs and a case.
