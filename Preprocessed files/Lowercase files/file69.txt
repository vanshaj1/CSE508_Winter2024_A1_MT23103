i previously purchased the 20' cable for my sg and marshall amp, and i was very satisfied. i have a couple of pedals with different variations that i wanted to incorporate, and the old saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" came to mind. so i ordered 2 of the 6' cables to complete my personal set up. you can't go wrong with these. great cords!
