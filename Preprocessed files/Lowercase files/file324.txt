i wanted to wait a few days and give this guitar some time before i reviewed it. i currently own 2 other dean guitars including a 12 string and i wanted to say that i bought this guitar based upon the reviews here on amazon which i most often do. i have to admit i really like dean humbuckers. this guitar did not disappoint.  it is beautiful, and that shiny chrome-like green neck with silver fret bars is awesome.  this guitar is very playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. i really like the sound it puts out and it does stay in tune contrary to the negative comments i read to the contrary.  i really like these tuners because they a precise. it sounds awesome through my zoom g5 effects pedal. i agree with the reviewer who said 'buy it now'.  you won't  be sorry.  this is now my main squeeze especially for anything rock. i recorded 4 iron maiden songs with it.  sweet!!!!!!!!  i love this guitar. i just love it.  i can't say that enough.
