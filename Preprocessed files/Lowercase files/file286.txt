great idea, but unfortunately the clamp doesnt work correctly. you can only adjust it with the tab in the closed position, as opposed to the position shown in the instructions, defeating the easy on/off feature. also the bracket that attaches the clamp to the cup holder uses a single screw, which loosened up while i was trying to attach the clamp to a mic stand. i was able to tighten it up, but i needed to remove the bracket in order to do so. further, even after tightening this screw, the bracket still had a tendency to swivel.
