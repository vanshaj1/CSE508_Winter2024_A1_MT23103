it works, for the price, for what it is. i needed a gig bag, at about 25 dollars in a hurry, for carrying my carry around bass around town- in/ out car, hanging out at coffee shops, walking around place to place. if i had about 50 dollars i would have bought the next model up, the g4 or whatever, with more padding, but i didn't, and this one is doing the job just fine. i have a precision bass copy (an epiphone accu-bass, hence the weird headstock) , and it fits in the bag.  the bag is protective enough and seems durable enough for the purpose of carrying the bass around town. the pocket won't hold much- just strings and some music, but the bag does carry the bass.
