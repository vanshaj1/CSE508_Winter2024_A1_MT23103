these are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise. i would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot. these will snap off fast. it didn't take too long for my son to snap the tip off doing a rim/head hit. if these are for a electric kit, i would give these a 5 star for that perpose
