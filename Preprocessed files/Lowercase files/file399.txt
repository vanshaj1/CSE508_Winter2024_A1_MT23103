this guitar is an amazing value!!! usa pups, chunky neck, and a fast fretboard (very round radius!) its the kind of guitar you never want to put down. switching options make it very versatile. my only criticism is the poly blonde finish is very plastic looking. thankfully the grain is showing through more and more every day. i leave mine in the sun and may repaint in the future.

this is a guitar youll want to keep for life. very, very satisfied.
