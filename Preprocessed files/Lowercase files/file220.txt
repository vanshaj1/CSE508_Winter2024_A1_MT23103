i received this pedal as a gift.  a compressor is a subtle effect, but it has made a great addition to my pedal board.  the construction of the pedal is solid.  it adds character to chords and enhances leads.  i am currently using the pedal with the sustain at 1 o'clock, the attack at noon, and the volume at 10 o'clock.  the volume provides a very strong boost after 11 o'clock.  overall, good pedal for the price.
