i upgraded the bass and tom tom heads on my pearl rhythm traveler kit (asin: b0002fo4r8) to these heads with amazing results. before upgrading the open bottom toms had a lot of ring and were impossible to get the tone i wanted no matter how carefully i tuned them. i replaced the heads with these and was rewarded with an amazing difference in sound quality. the ringing, hollow quality i previously struggled to correct is now a nice "thump" sound that works perfectly with jazz and rock.

in addition to this head i upgraded to the 10" (asin: b0002e1fqw) on my other mounted tom and the 14" (asin: b0002d0dso) on my floor tom.  the results were so dramatic that i also upgraded the batter side head on my bass drum with the 20" bass drum head (asin: b0002d0e3s).

in addition to achieving the exact sound i wanted i also get far better stick response, and have found that tuning these heads are far easier than any other head i've used, including remo that i use on my ludwig kit.

these heads have transformed a relatively inexpensive drum kit into a professional quality kit that is incomparable in sound and performance.
