i have only had this pedal a few hours. it does what they say, maybe better than they say. i ran it through its paces with my telecaster and was amazed. it can sound like the very costly lesley pedals that go for near $400 but all that for only $50. i am happy, only 4 stars because i don't trust behringer. i never had any of their stuff last that long.
