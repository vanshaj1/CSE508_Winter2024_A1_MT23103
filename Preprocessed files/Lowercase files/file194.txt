superb feel and sound!

tips for wah success:
- rock pedal all of the way forward
- match the volume knob to your bass
- crank the "q"
- love life!

seriously, the range this pedal hits when the "q" is amazing. i love how expressive the tone is when you get it going! i think it retains the low end and adds a creamy wah in the highs and mids. don't listen to nay-sayers that claim you lose lows!

to put it bluntly, it's needed on your board!
i've used it with delays, octave up/downs, and overdrives, and just the straight-up clean; never found a sound i didn't like or couldn't use!

buy it.
