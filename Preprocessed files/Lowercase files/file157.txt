i have owned two martins over the years. i have been playing only electric guitars the last many years. i came across some old songs i wrote for the acoustic guitar. i tested several guitars because i wanted a nice kick back acoustic that covered all the base and mids i remember from the martin coffee house days. i did not like the new guitars, they did not sound the way i remember them. i walked out of my favorite music stores with out any guitar. my friend told me to try a canadian made guitar a seagull. i never heard of them. i saw a few for sale used, that's good because i wanted an old one. i tested a 1996 s6 seagull and the sound, power and tone from this guitar was fantastic. i bought it, set the action very low and put some #9 strings one it. this cedar top has a magic to it and i am pleased with this one. just as fine to play as the crazy priced guitars.
