all i can say is wow! this has to be the best amp at this price. i chose this over the fender and i'm glad i did. it is clean-sounding smooth has a great tone nice design easily move it around even though it does weigh over 30 lb. this is a bargain i'm glad i went with this brand. the size is big enough to punch out for mid sized church functions with ease! the pic doesn't really show u the size. it's bigger than the pic puts out. no distortion just a clean bass sound... again a bargain and i will buy a bigger one in the future!
