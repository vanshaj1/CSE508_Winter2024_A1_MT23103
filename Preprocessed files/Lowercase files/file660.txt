you just can't beat these hohner blues harmonicas in terms of what you get for the money. very good sound and playablity, durable, and not too expensive but the price does keep going up. i have 7 of them, some go back years and years (i like lee oskar harps too, but i prefer the blues harp as it's "throatier"). i see some reviewers have complained that it's hard on the lips or is not very durable; don't know where they're comin' from, no problems for me here (i have a bunch of hohner pro harps and they do hurt your lips; as for durabilty: only my oldest blues harp, the a, has a reed out, mainly because i played it for years like a 3 lung madman, the others are in perfect condition). if you want a diatonic harmonica that sounds better than this be prepared to cough up in excess of $100, otherwise get this.
