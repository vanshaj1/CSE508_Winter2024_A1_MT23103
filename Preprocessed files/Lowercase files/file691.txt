fit my 2007 miusa strat which i purchased gutted and i'm slowly getting parts for. i just got the switch and machine heads and i still need the pick-ups. since it's an 07 i felt that i could hot rod with out getting ostracized for it. i'm also going to do a hand carved inlay on the body. the guitar is being built for a give away to commemorate 19 years serving indie music. the image is a 1977 fender musicmaster miusa, the part i got is the same going on a fender strat
