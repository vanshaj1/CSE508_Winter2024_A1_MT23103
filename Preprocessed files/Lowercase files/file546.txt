for the price of tunable bongos you get 3 roto-toms and a stand.  an inexpensive way to expand your current drum set.

hardware is ok at best buy for this price one can't complain. it does the job.

i placed the stand between the 10 & 8 inch toms and the hi-hat between the 6 & 8 inch toms.

a great deal for $99.00.
