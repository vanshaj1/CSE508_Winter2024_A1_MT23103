as with other dean guitars this does not disappoint. finish is perfect at least on mine. grover tuners that stay in tune(my gibson sg's???).
the price is so low for the sound and quality and tolerance of construction. low action, balanced feel with the neck. abalone dot inlays or made to look abalone. pickups are good to go, but height maybe adjusted. the semi hollow sounds rule and adds depth and character. have two other dean guitars and the finish and quality and wood is there.
this is still a very active guitar with the angled bolt-on neck. no loss there. binding is quality too.
for the $$$ nothing even close. beautiful to look at and play.
