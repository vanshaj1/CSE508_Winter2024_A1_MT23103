okay, the idea is good, but the materials used are inferior. what good is a locking mechanism if the cheap plastic breaks off? the plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. luckily it was right at the end of a song as i played the last chord, and i held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. but it could have, i was just lucky. where the strap loops onto the plastic mechanism is the weak link. the locking part is a good idea. not going to trust this thing with my instruments though. i had an old ernie ball spare strap in my case with simple leather ends. i will use it from now on.
