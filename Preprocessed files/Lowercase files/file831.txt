this thing is fantabulous! a great product! for the price and quality and performance. i use it on my upright bass. it gives me the volume and tone i want. playing it through my peavey tnt 100 bass amp i place it on the lower belly under the strings with the jack on the side secured by velcro. i use industrial strength velcro. i may place it lower with the wire hidden beneath. it gives me the top end and the bottom. i highly recommend it. although it is durable, i'm going to buy two more. just because it is the best adaptor for the quality and for the money.
