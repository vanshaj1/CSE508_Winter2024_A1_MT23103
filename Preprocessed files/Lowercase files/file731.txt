so far so good. never heard of lazarro and who cares? the saxophone can perform. the brand doesn't matter. it is just a label. i'm on month 5 and it is holding up. play it everyday. upgraded the mouthpiece to a clark forbes debut mouthpiece. the reeds that the sax comes with isn't that great. mine came with lazarro reeds 2 1/2 strength and now i use d'addario select jazz reeds 3s and it does the trick.  if you know how to take care of the saxophone it'll last. well worth the investment. this is the perfect saxophone for those looking for a great instrument without paying hundreds to thousands of dollars.
