i purchased two of these to hang guitars in my music room. these are well made and certainly do the job okay. however, i completely did not trust the two skimpy screws they provided to hang this unit. they are basically drywall screws, but these have a rather skinny diameter. i was not about to trust my vintage p-bass to a skinny screw inside a hollow-wall fastener. no, i used a heavier "construction screw" directly into a wall stud. see photo. i was seriously concerned that the supplied skinny screw would actually break off in the stud. if you are hanging a lightweight acoustic, then the supplied hardware should be fine. i'm probably just being paranoid and overly cautious.  other than that, i like it (tho walnut piece could be a little bigger in my opinion).
