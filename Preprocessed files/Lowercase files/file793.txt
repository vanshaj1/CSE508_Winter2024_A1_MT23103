just what i needed, although at it's lowest setting, wass about an inch too tall for me sitting on the edge of my bed. ive gotten used to it now so it's all good! like others have said, it's good quality and sturdy construction. i stubbed my toe on it in the night, and quickly wished that hadn't happened! the rubber grip on top is actually riveted on, so that should last a good while. i also used this for when i practice standing up. i rest my foot on it which pushes the bottom of my guitars out so i can see what i'm doing. all in all its a good product and i recommend it. a word of warning, this is made of strong metal, if you're buying this for your son or daughter, show them the dangers of the scissoring action of the legs. i imagine they could do some hurtin to little fingers.
