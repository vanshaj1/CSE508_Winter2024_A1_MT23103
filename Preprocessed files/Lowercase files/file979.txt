i chose this beater just so that i could be more like bonham.  it has replaced the stock yamaha beater on my direct drive 9500 pedal.  it is very light and it feels great coming off the batter head.  i have not made any adjustments since swapping out the beater, but i am considering putting a little weight on the beater to make it feel a little more significant.  as far as sound, it's the old school thump.  with my 24", it rings ever so beautifully.  this may not work so well for hard rock or metal.  too much bong and not enough bop.
