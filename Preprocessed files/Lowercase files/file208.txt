i wanted to add karaoke to my services for my mobile dj business and was looking for something that didn't cost and arm and a leg. i wanted to find something mobile, easy to set-up & affordable. after reading reviews, it was a no brainer so i made the purchase. the stand is sturdy, light, portable & very easy to set-up. i have my 20" sharp aquos mounted on it (see pictures uploaded), and it took me less than five minutes to set up! the only complaint i have is the screws for the mic holders do not fit. they are a tad too big. either the screws are too big or the holes were not made large enough. it's no big deal. i highly recommend this product. buy it!!!
