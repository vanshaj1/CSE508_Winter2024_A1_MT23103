i have screwed the base as tight as i can get it, but the weight of my speakers (powered ev15's 2 way) causes the tripod to start to fold up.
1.) it's kind of a safety concern... it doesn't go all the way. but rather just dropping a bit due to the weight.
2.) it's virtually impossible to get the pair i own at the same height due to one always dropping the center pole down a bit. this causes a visual effect that is not desirable for weddings etc. (drives me nuts myself)

other than that, they are small and compact, they have a springy middle pole, that's kinda cool.
