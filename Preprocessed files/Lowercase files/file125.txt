competitors had detailed drawings and better pictures causing me to worry i'd made a mistake with these. luckily, when i tried to cancel, i was too late. these dandies hold the pickguard firmly and even better-the correct countersink, satiny color & flatish profile make them nearly disappear into the pickguard. perfection!
