i'd give it 5-stars if it was filled-in around the connector (cleaner look and easier to hit in the dark).  otherwise it was a great solution to cleanly put  an access port on the front of my portable recording rig.  i have lots of usb-a to usb-b cables about, so that connected me to a standard usb audio interface inside the rack also with a b connector.  i already had another b-to-a adapter like this for a usb charging jack that is reversed, with the a-b cable on the inside going to a standard usb charger.

btw, mixed responses in the q/a section.  they may be coming from different suppliers or maybe not genuine switchcraft, as mine did not come with any screws.
