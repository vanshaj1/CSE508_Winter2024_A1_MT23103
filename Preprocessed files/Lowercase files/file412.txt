i recently got a used, but excellent, epiphone junior.  i've been playing for over fifty years and owned many -- many quite fine, costly, guitars. but as others have discovered, these older, p90-equipped epis belie their cost. they play and sound great.  with one exception: they come with pretty poor tuners.

a guitar forum friend had suggested these grovers and i'm glad i listened. they are quality pieces that, apart from the mounting screw placement, are complete "drop ins."

fairly priced here on amazon.  i could not be more pleased!
