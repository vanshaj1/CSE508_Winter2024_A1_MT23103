this is the second chromacast hard guitar case that i have purchased and i like both of them! i needed a hard case for my schecter omen-6 guitar. i find myself playing this guitar more and more. i had bought a schecter hard guitar case from amazon warehouse deals but it didn't fit my guitar (the description said it would). i emailed chromacast and they said the cc-ehc case would work. it's a really nice case! it's a good value for the price. i saw the bad reviews for this guitar case and i can tell you that have not had a problem with either one of my cases.
