this singing bowl is perfect for just taking a few minutes out of each day while listening and feeling the songs. i was not surprised at the smaller size of the bowl but i was surprised by the excellent quality and tone of this singing bowl. it is a true instrument that begs to be played.
i plan on a couple of other bowls in the near future to enhance a rather growing set of metal and ceramic bowls i have.
for a beginner to singing bowls, creating your first song is simple just follow the instructions and take a few minutes to watch thier video of getting started.
