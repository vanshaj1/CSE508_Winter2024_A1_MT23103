omg! this is perfect ! i was hesitant to go drilling a hole in my ukelele but wanted to have the option of amplification. this fit the bill with easy quick insallation ! no miss no fuss and it produces great ,clear wonderful sounds . i placed the pads in a triangular formation from the bridge down to the sound hole. i did take a tip from someone and got glued the solder joints on the piezos for added protection. 30 minutes total install time and that's cuz i have big club hands lol  . this is a true bargain quality piece comparable to the kk mini but about 80.00 $ cheaper .  in fact i used the kk installation video online to do the job . highly recommended !
