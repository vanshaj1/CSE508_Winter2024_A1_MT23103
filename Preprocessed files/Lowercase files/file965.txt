not bad at all for the price.  cheaper on amazon than ebay.  installation was straight forward after watching some youtube videos.  i would watch out for the exact shape when cutting the holes in the body.  the larger piece has a couple of 'clipped' corners that need to be left on the body for the screws to grab.  sounds great and the tuner is accurate.
