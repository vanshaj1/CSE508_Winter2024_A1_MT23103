within a month of buying the device, the door that covers the sd card snapped off - a common problem with these recorders. very poorly engineered.

last week i pulled the device out of a padded camera bag and one of the plastic (painted to look like metal) xlr ejector tabs had broke off.

i needed to capture a recording off a mixing board with the balanced jack and had to use an xlr cable. i thought there was enough of the ejector to remove it but it's stuck. i disassembled the cable and have done everything i can to remove it short of opening the recorder.

tascam wants me to send it into them, and from the stories i hear they are probably going to charge me $90 to fix a device that is less than a year old.

i will probably use a hacksaw to get the plug off and just use it as is until it dies. i'll buy a zoom next time. it's a shame because this device records great, even though the omni mics. for this much $ tascam needs to prove quality, especially if they are going to say a product is rugged.
