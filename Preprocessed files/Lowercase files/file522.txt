this was my first ukulele. it played great right out of the box. action was good and comfortable. it sounded great with martin m600s. i did not like aquilas on this one as much.

i have since owned many more expensive ukuleles, including k-brand ukes that are over $700, and are supposedly "set-up" from one of the community favorite ukulele sites. and i will tell you that i have found more problems with the build and set-up of those $700+ ukuleles than what i found on this kala.

looking back a year from now, i really miss the sound and feel of this ukulele. it was cheap, it played well, and it had that cheap laminated ukulele sound that is very charming.
