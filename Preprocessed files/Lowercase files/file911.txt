wow this thing is so cool i play it threw two orange 8" cabs it is my favorite practice amp by far. three knows zero bull $#!+. once i turn it up around 2 my dog starts to howl no joke i really goes. i'm going to try jamming with it here soon and see how it contends with my brute of a drummer. it can go from clean to pretty dirty but if you really want to get nasty you will need a nice hot humbucker and a distortion pedal. i dug it's sound i didn't bother with a pedal for the first week. can't go wrong for the price. the little tube in the preamp does really make it sound good.
