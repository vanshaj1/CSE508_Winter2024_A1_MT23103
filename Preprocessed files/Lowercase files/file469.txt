way better than i was expecting.

i was recently upgrading all the parts on my first strat, and a buddy told me the trem system upgrade would be the biggest. i'm glad i listened to him and got this, because it was night and day.

i'm not sure if it's just me, because i'm using my old springs, but my guitar stays in tune better now when using the trem bar.

i uploaded a photo to show how small and light my old trem block was compared to this one.

side note...everything fit perfectly using my old screws. no pickguard shaving necessary.
