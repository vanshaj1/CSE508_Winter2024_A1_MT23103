first off this is not a leather strap. only the ends are leather. i've owned this model in 3" several times. i keep coming back because of the style. but the glue they use to piece the front and back together cannot stand sweat. so it separates pretty quickly, after about 4 uses. the sad thing is the strap is made quite well except for the plastic end that holds the nylon strap part to it. if it breaks, your $2000 plus guitar takes a dive. using strap locks, i would prefer if they used a metal part instead of the plastic part. but the separation is a real downer. all they would have to do is sew or use better glue. they must know this is a factory defect, but for many years now all my straps have done the same exact separation in the same exact place. total i have purchased a dozen of these straps for my guitars.
