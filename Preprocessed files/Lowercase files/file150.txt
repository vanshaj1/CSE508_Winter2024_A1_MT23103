this stand is very portable and compact, but i no longer have confidence in it's ability to keep my electric basses safe. my vintage fender jazz bass would not fit correctly due to the offset body shape and a few years ago it fell over causing significant damage to the headstock (see picture). after this, i resigned to use this stand only with my fender precision bass which has a more symmetrical body shape, but even this bass has come close to falling over if not placed just so. i've decided to go back to the more traditional type of guitar stand for my instruments.
