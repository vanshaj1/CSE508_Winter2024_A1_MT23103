at first, this would not work with the at2020 usb+  microphone.  the pole is too thick to screw into the mount that comes with the mic.

then i discovered that there is a silver removable nut inside the stand that comes with the mic. once that was unscrewed and removed, this stand fit perfectly.

stand itself, nice and sturdy. makes the mic stand a bit taller than the stock tripod stand, which is just terrible.
