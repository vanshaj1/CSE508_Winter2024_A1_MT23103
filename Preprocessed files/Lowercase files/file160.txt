i have been playing for about 25 years on all kinds of gear. my armand ride and hats never change, the crashes do from time to time. thought i would try a wuhan crash. it sounds so good. i am so pleasantly surprised. the sound is bright and warm at the same time. the decay is not fast, but not too long either. even the bell sounds good. i just ordered an 18 gong crash and a 10 splash. i'll let you know!
