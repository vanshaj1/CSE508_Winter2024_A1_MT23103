well...it plays perfectly, but the once clear, white on blue lettering rubs right off. body's natural oils... rub whatever paint they use. i'm considering buying a perm marker in a bright color and drawing them on again. yes, the gold side is embossed, so it won't rub off, but it's the blue on white that a person looks to for quickly identifying notes. long-term, it's more about the pitches being stable/etc., but i'm disappointed that only after three uses, the lettering is rubbing off. put a better finish on these things...coat it with something non-toxic, but non-reactive with oils/acids from people's fingers since that's what we'll be using when we hold the things. other than storage at home, the soft pouch is useless.
