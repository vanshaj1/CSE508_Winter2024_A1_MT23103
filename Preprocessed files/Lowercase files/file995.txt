i installed these myself using the elenco electronics st-12 soldering tool kit on a 2012 fender american stratocaster. i didn't like the custom shop fat 50's that were installed. i wanted something that could growl, that was noiseless but still kept the chime of the king tone and these pickups deliver. i adjusted them a couple of times (not too high) and may have found the sweet spot. i don't change pickups too often but the fat 50's sounded too farty and muffled to my ears. i also like to play a wide range of styles ranging from jeff beck jazz to yngwie neoclassical to john mayer blues. these pickups are able to handle those styles easily. most importantly they are dead silent and that's important when you're doing a lot of recording.
