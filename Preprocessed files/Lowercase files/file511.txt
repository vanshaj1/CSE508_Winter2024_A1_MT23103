i loved using this while producing videos with my canon eos 6d, but it didn't last long.  when i inserted the battery into the receiver, one of the battery contacts broke off.  here are some pictures of the receiver mounted on my eos 6d and a picture showing the broken contact wire.  the battery holder has a bad design because the contacts are weak wire loops and the battery fits very snug and puts a lot of pressure on these weak contacts.  samson should update the battery holder design.  i still recommend this wonderful wireless system, just something to be aware of.
