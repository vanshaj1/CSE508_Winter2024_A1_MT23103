i was afraid to order this after reading so many bad reviews about holes not lining up. so i have to weigh in and say that it fits my 1994 black label fender p-bass perfectly. it was a tight fit, but after some wiggling and strategic pressing around the pickups, it finally sat down. my original pickguard was an off white (originally white, but it aged), on a cream/off white body. i wasn't a fan of the look, so i got the tortoise shell color. see my photo to see how it turned out!

oh! one thing to note: the pickguard came slightly warped. i think it was because the amazon delivery driver had the envelope package on his hot dashboard in 100 degree texas weather. i don't blame the manufacturer for this. i put the pickguard between two heavy pieces of glass and left it outside for a couple hours to get it to lay flat. no problemo.
