i have a garage sale piece of junk mij hollowbody that i've used amazon to build for cheap.  it's been a blast and this fit the bill perfectly.

i cannot tell you how surprised i am at how good this sounds with this guitar.  it has inspired me to play open tuning slide because the tone through a simple boss distortion pedal is so cool.

i would absolutely purchase this again for another cheapo build!

if you're looking at this, buy it.  don't think twice.
