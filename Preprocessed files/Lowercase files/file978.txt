this model sounds and plays as well as any guitar i've ever owned. even my custom clapton strat in daphne blue.
you won't be able to put it down. the daphne blue is the sweetest color. yeah. it's mexican but it is flawless.
only tip- test drive a few. mine actually has a mild flame neck.
i promise. if you get it it will turn into a favorite instantly. better craftsmanship than some american mades. i'm dead serious.
