i could not imagine this product was so small but so powerful at the same time. i am using it in my analog mastering room, as a media reader. especially interesting for the bluetooth connectivity. connecting the output to one input of a samson c control studio controller, and there you go... send the sound wherever you want to direct it in the studio.
