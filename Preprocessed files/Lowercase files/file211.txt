i like these microphpone windscreens and the price can't be beat. i have a few lavalier microphones and wanted to use them for recording outdoors. unfortunately they are larger than what i would consider a lav mic windscreen. i have found they work best with my olympus me51s lav mic and they significantly reduced wind/ambient noise outside. the colors are nice and help in location them and not misplacing them. i have lost so many small black lav wind screens that if i had a dime...well you know the rest. i included a picture in the customer gallery so you can see beyond the stock photo what you're buying. i would recommend and just mention again, be aware of the size you're getting.
