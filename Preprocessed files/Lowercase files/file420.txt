i have a 1986 peavey patriot made in the usa guitar. it had one cheap string tree that wasn't a roller. these work great! make sure to drill the holes for any of these trees you are going to install. the included screw cannot handle the pressure of screwing it in. i will add pictures soon. you won't be disappointed. they add incredible sustain to my guitar!
