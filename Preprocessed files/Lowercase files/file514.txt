i have four of these i purchased at my local guitar shop didn't buy from amazon. they are the exact same cables however and i think they are far too stiff and rigid. example you can see visible wrinkles and feel the tension work against you when plugging these into pedals. i mean quite a bit of resistance as in unnecessary amount. durable yes and that's great but i'm running a pedalboard for guitars not pullin trucks out of mud pits damn. they do sound okay but nothing special. look pretty cool too but looks aren't what's getting it done. overpriced in my opinion as are most fender cables. not a huge fan and prefer lower profile pancake type patch cables mogami sounds better , easier to work with and the pedals can be kept much neater and closer to save space. that means room for "more toys!" hooked a few pedals together off the board and took a couple pics so you can get an idea of the tension and overall in my opinion sloppy fit of these cables.
