i own 4 gibsons and 3 fenders. and this guitar. i've played this against mim fender teles and imo, this guitar sounds better, even with just the stock pups. no, seriously. my guitar guy says the same thing. i put ernie ball 9s on mine and it plays really good. i don't care where it's made nor what it costs, it is a great guitar for the money. very solid build and save for a few rough fret edges it came in great shape. a tele with some distortion is one of life's great sounds imo. recommended. cheers
