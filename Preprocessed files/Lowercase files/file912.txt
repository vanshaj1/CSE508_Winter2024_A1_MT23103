a few weeks ago i bought the wp (white pearl) stickers which i really liked although i even said in my review that they have a slightly gray or silver cast to them. i just got another set, this time the awp (aged white pearl) set and i'm glad i did. tbhey do not look like stickers and you really can't tell unless you get your nose right on them. these actually look like aged pearl. they look freakin real. check the image, it shows the wp set on the left and the awp on the right. the pics aren't too good but good enough that you can see the difference..

  the first set (wp) was impressive as to the fit, sizing etc. but for realism you can't beat the new set (awp) at least not at this price.
