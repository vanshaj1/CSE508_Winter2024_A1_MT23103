great value for a hard case, holds lots of guitars, including jaguar, or even a les paul. only issue is... that there's not enough padding,  and some guitars might knock around if you don't add some additional support.

update:  this case can hold a variety of guitars, including a jaguar, les paul, strat, tele, and g&l fallout.  as i mentioned previously, you may need to add some padding or a velcro strap over the next report to stabilize the guitar.
 i also added a picture with a epi sh inside.
