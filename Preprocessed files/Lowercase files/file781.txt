i have a gibson les paul standard from 2013 with burstbucker pros.  supposedly the burstbucker pro is wound to sound like the original paf (how they actually sounded), while the classic 57 is wound to the original design specification of pafs (how they were supposed to be made). i just picked up a gorgeous gibson es-335 from 2001 with the classic 57, and man, i like this way better than the burstbucker pro!  both are great pickups, but these have such great bite in the lead and smooth in neck i can stop listening to it.  every note rings so nicely.  between the 2 pickups i can find great jazzy/bluesy tones and some to just rock out!  i can't say enough about it, except i'm really neglecting my chores with all the time i'm spending now enjoying these!

5 stars!  don't expect anything less than awesome!
