i like this little small light! it fits in your hand and is a decent output of light. it is dmx which we all know is awesome! dmx makes the world a little easier to control! the colors are red green blue and white. the only thing i do not like is the way the colors are mixed, you can see the outside of the color when you mix them. i would put one quad led in the fixture so it's all under one lense and there's no bleeding. but other than that this fixture is awesome!
