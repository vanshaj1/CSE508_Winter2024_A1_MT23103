for practical purposes, these patches are thin (which i like) and clear (if you get the clear ones).  they are not hard "plasticky" (yes, i made up a new word...remember you heard it here first) but have a snug, comfortable feel under the teeth. i use them on my obrien crystal and richard hawkins model g mouthpieces and they look great.  now, the best thing about them for me personally is the r....my name is robert.  hah.  looks like i have custom mouthpiece patches. ;-)
