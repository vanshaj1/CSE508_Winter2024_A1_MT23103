i have worked in radio for over 12 years as well as voiceover.  my main microphone has been the big brother to this one.  most radio studios you enter use the re20.  that being said when i recieved this re 320 i was blown away.  i have done my radio show with it exclusively for the past 8 months and love it!  this mic rocks!  this microphone has xlr connections so be sure to use good mixer with those standard connections for a top quality mic like this.  when you first get this microphone you immediately notice the professional look and feel to it.  it is all that you would imagine it to be. simply put this mic is top quality and produces great sound even without processing.  5 stars!
