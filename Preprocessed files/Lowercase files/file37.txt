these capos are easy to use, high quality materials, flawless mecanism, adjustable pressure, an investment for a life. just be know that there are two versions:
 perfomance 1 (discontinued) : extremely nice pressure and good looking, a little bulky, but non intrussive, the best choice for long scale guitar (25.4").
performance 2 (new version) : light and narrow, easy to handle with one hand, the only con is that it lacks a little in pressure (compared to p1). i will use it in a short scale (24.9") guitar.
pd: i have only try it on my acoustic 25.4 scale martin 1 3/4 " neck. i own both and i love the performance 1 better. look at the pics to see the differences between both.
