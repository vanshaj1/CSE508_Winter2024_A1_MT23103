got to use my new phitz bag for my five aputure amaran 672w for the first time yesterday. i was getting tired of always packing them in their individual cases. it's very well-made with really good quality zippers and construction, with roomy front and side pouches i haven't even used yet. :) the bag comes with 10 dividers (i only used 8...description says it comes with 8, but i'm pretty sure i got 10) which can be repositioned with velcro (probably much neater than i've done here).

to be fair, this is a softside padded case, so i won't be throwing it around like a stevedore, but the quick-draw action makes it fast and easy to pull the lights for set up. and packing is faster, too.

this bag is so well-constructed, i'm sure i'll be using it for years to come.

full disclosure: i haven't been paid for this post, nor did i get the product for free. i just like spreading the news of great, relatively inexpensive, functional products when i get them.
