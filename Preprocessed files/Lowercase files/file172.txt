these stands are excellent. they are well built and easy to assemble. they come with an allen wrench and that is the only tool needed. the stand has a nice design when it comes to the base. there are 3 soft rubber pads that come on the stand. they also give you 3 pointed metal spikes that you can put on, which is perfect if placing on a rug. the spikes are adjustable so you can get set for the rug height and get the stand perfectly level. i put a pair of jbl monitor speakers (lsr305) on this stand for my yamaha piano dgx-650b. see attached pictures. the stands look like they were made to go with this piano.

the quality of the metal is good despite other reviews. there are pins that allow you to lock the stand in a certain height and you don't have to worry about it lowering on its own. it comes with wire guides so you can run your cables tight to the stand making it look neat. i cant say enough good things about these stands.
