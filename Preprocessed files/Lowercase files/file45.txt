bought two of these at the same time and one arrived broken in two spots. the adjustment screw was missing on the base (see photo) and the one for the top part was stripped out.  both screws are made of plastic with some kind of cheap pot metal fittings that likely don't take much force to break.

it's a 20 mile drive to the nearest ups store to return these or i have to pay for pickup.  it wasn't worth it for something that costs $15 so i drilled a small hole and tapped a small screw into it.  if i had an easier option to return it, i would and get something else.  the one that wasn't broke on arrival works well but i'm not holding my breath it will last long or survive falling over more than once.
