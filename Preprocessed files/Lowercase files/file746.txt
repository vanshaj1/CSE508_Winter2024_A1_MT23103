question:  are you better off with a hard case? the problem with ukes is that they can get squished.  also, it's a soprano ukulele!! how much can a hard case weigh?  if you have a hard case, you can throw it in the trunk of your car, pile things on top of it...

however, the answer may be that the chances of your uke getting damaged may be quite small and most hard cases are larger and heavier, even if it's only a pound or two. if you're looking for a gigbag, then the phitz bags can't be beat!  solid construction with heavy canvas and strong zippers. definitely my go-to gigbag when i want a gigbag. also, can be a real attention getter.
