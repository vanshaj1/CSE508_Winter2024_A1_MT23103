i was looking for an second inexpensive ukulele for traveling or camping.  to my surprise this is a wonderful ukulele!  its light weight construction makes its tone warm, bright and rich.  the construction on the instrument is very high quality.  if your looking for a beautifully designed comfortable playing ukulele, look no more.  even the etching on the body is very nice.  luna makes a few other designs in this etched series.  so if you don't like this design there are others to choose from.  i would highly recommend luna's mahogany mo's concert ukulele to anyone who wants a high quality ukulele without spending a lot of money. and it even comes with a nice soft luna case.
