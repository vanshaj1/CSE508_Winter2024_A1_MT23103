its flimsy and for the awkward angles it sticks in a guitar the vox device should be metal and sturdy, especially for price.  mine broke within a week and i am a just a living room player.  i don't know how it broke but it did.  i will upload pictures.

now aside of the cheaply made product it served its purpose for the time it lasted and provided sound through headphones,  but its better to get a portable amp.
