i own 3 of these minis.  quality on this one is the worst. glue joints at the neck/body were messy. had a couple of small dings (see photo of one under strings near bridge) but the important stuff is ok ( neck is straight and the bridge is sound). fret edges are very smooth. sounds great but not as good as the ovangkol.
