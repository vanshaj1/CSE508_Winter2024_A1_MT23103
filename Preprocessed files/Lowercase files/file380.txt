ok i gave these tuners a 5 and i've not installed them on the fender strat they're intended for. made in the usa machine heads is what i wanted for the miusa strat. i'm doing a custom strat to raise funds for my web site which is dedicated to indie music. i bought this guitar gutted and still need pick-ups and hand carved inlay. i will update when i string the guitar and play a few licks.

i look forward to working with proaudio in the future

these will not fit my american made strat or the kramer st300 both have 2 holes. i'll have to modify those guitars to make them work and i'm not willing to do that at this point so they'll sit on the shelf.

3/6/2018: i did modify the kramer st300 and these machine heads look great. the kramer has the floyd rose locking nut which kind of defeats the locking tuners although it is very helpful winding new strings.
