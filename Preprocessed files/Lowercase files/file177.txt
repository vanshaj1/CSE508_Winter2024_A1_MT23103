not as advertised.  they claim these are rapco horizon cables, but they are actually stagemaster - whoever that is.  rapco horizon cables offer a lifetime warranty and they last!!!  i have some that are just going bad after 14 years of weekly use.  this is a bait and switch - do not be deceived like i was.
