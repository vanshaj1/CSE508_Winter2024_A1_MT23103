this is everything you want in a fuzz box.  mid scoop, custom-dialed mid boost or additional cut, bass boost, noise gate, and a special attack knob to add in certain frequencies to give attack back to the muff sound, if desired.  ehx listened to a decade of online feedback on the nyc 3-knob big muff pi and added every must-have addition into a single pedal.

every non-germanium voicing ready to go with a tone-shaping mid boost/cut footswitch that's perfect for lead work, a high quality noise gate to silence the idle hum, and a big fat bottom-end boost toggle.  if you're in the market for fuzz, make sure to test this monster out.  it'll beat boutique pedals that cost 50-100% more.
