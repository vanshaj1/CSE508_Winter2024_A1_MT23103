i purchased this kit to have an organized and efficient way of changing my guitar strings (electric and acoustic). i like that the tools are all organized in one pouch, there are slots for string set(s), so that you never have to worry about being unprepared for a guitar emergency (hence the name "gig" mate).

i'm the kit, you get:
canvas kit with elastic holders for individual tools
flashlight (batteries included, led bright)
screwdriver
allen wrenches
string winder
action gauge (if you have an action preference, this is handy for making adjustments consistently)

the one thing i did add, that was not included was a plastic bridge pin puller. i didn't want to subject my taylor to poking and prodding to pull pins.
