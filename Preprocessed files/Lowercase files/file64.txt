this would be my fourth ocarina wind ocarina. it is by far my favorite. i love the "sound of earth" design. the mouthpiece is perfectly sized. the body design is very comfortable and feels natural to hold. the rough finish makes it feel sturdy and adds some nice grip! the slight indent at the subholes makes it very easy and comfortable to use them. (my trumpet creeper ocarina's subholes are a pain, and the "rythym of the earth" are a little close, i am always hitting them on accident!) it is also the most in tune, all notes! it has a great, mellow but resonating sound. i would love to see more aesthetics with this body design! i truly was surprised. i have 3 other ocarinas from them that are more than reasonably priced for decent product, but this one in particular blew my expectations out of the water! i definitely recommend this for any level, especially beginner at this price. it is worth much more than what it is being sold for! i actually bought another!
 *i have noticed a new brand stamping/etching design in their products, a nice little touch! not ugly or gaudy.  simple & classic!
