i find this unit adequate, i use it with my macbook as part of a portable 'winter' studio. i also own a scarlet 2i2 (gen 1)  which i use in my primary studio  i find the 2i2 has superior sound quality  less audible distortion / lower noise  and i prefer the 2i2's neutrik style xlr/trs output connector. the behringer is a good value  it works fine and has good features / performance for the price  but like other behringer products i've used, the sound quality / noise / distortion, leave me wanting a better product. if features or budget are at the top of your list, this product should do the job; if however sound quality is of primary importance then i'd recommend the scarlet 2i2 (look for sales or a used gen 1).
