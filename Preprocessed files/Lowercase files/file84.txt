this is the second neewer boom arm i have purchased, as i have added a second recording capable computer to my battle station for my son to be able to record voice and gameplay. i was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing i disliked about mine had been changed. the mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. my previous mount had a d-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. it was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. the upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.
the stalk mount is now round, allowing for a near tight fit, without any wobble. the mount itself appears to be a thicker casting, as well as a sliding bar style clamp system allowing for a more tighter and secure hold on your desk. i am super pleased with this arm, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great budget boom arm.
