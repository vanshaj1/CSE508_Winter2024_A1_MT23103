i installed a set of these on my epiphone g400 pro. they offer better prevention of guitar straps slipping off than the stock strap buttons provide. these pins also have a lower profile than the stock pins. they are a single piece pin, versus strap lock that have two pieces that lock together. installation was very easy and the provided hardware fit with no issues. these strap pins give me piece of mind and they look awesome too!
