i like tascam products. i have a rack mounted digital recorder, a cd player and a small digital recorder. the 100mkii is also a very good recorder but i have some complaints: the battery life is short maybe because it uses only 2 cells. the volume control is very close to the phone jack making adjustment a bit dificult. the door of the aa cells seems the door of a cheap toy; it could be more robust. apart from these minor details i'm well satisfied with the product.
