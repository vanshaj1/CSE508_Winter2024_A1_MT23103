i've had this tuner for about 4 years and it's been great. it tunes fine. for a long time the tuner just sat in my room, but recently i started taking the tuner around to practice and transporting it in my bag. unfortunately one of the 3 plastic pieces where the gooseneck attaches to the tuner broke off. it still works but the head sometimes falls off of the tuner. now i'm looking for a clip on tuner that is a little more durable. if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.

i've added a photo that shows where one of the plastic pieces is missing (so you can see the joint)
