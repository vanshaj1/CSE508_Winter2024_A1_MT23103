it's definitely tiny. they weren't kidding about that. that being said, the screen is 1"x1", but pretty bright and easy to read. the colors are rich, which helps. i play 6, 7, and 8 string guitars and was able to tune all 3 with no problems. quick detection, and accurate. even the f# on the 8 string was picked up almost instantly.

it may be a drawback for some, but there's no option for a 9v battery. pick up a donner 9v plug w/ that comes with a pig tail that has 5 9v plugs on it.

he's a tiny little feller, but big things come in small packages.
