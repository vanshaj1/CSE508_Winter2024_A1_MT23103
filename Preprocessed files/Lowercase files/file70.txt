perfect slide if you want more control over patterns and fingering as you play. the finger you use the slide on can bend and is free to do work as well! plus the brass keeps it nice and chunky. ive got small hands for a guy, i wear small to medium gloves, size 8-9 ring finger so based on the product  description i figured this would fit perfectly on my middle finger so i could do slide and chord mixtures. wont go over my second knuckle on my middle finger which should be around a size 10-11. after trying tons of glass, chrome, and brass full slides, i found this small slide to be perfect for what i play.
