these are alot better than the mahalo felt picks i've been using on my ukuleles. the mahalos are soft, fat and flat, these are stiff, thinner and tapered, meaning they're easier to hold and play with and i get sharper sound. the 12 i got should last for quite some time, the mahalos are showing more wear. probably everyone should get some felt picks, very useful and alot of fun; these are really good ones.
