this product so far has been absolutely stunning. i believe that it most definitely can be used for professional soundtracks and music. but duh, fl studio is for the super duper professionals, blah, blah, blah. i use it for my youtube channel it's been nothing but wonders for me! it's funny because when i first received the item, i sucked at doing anything on this software. then, five days later of experience and watching about two videos on this, i felt like a confident pro! if you're frustrated at first with the software then don't fret. you're not the only one, and you'll get the hang of it.
