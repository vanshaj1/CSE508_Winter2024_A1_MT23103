i am 61 years old,been playing since 14. i have bought 4 or 5 crescents over the years and have not found a lemon yet. these are great guitars!!!!!! i left the strings that came with it on,and after they quit stretching(like any set of strings will do)it stays perfectly tuned. i will be buying more to start a good collection and would highly recommend this to a friend. it is a keeper for sure!!

this is the review i gave some months back. i thought i would give an update.
since purchasing this guitar,i have also purchased a rondo sx,hadean tele,epiphone les paul, huntington tele, davison strat and an oscar schmidt les paul. i play in an old 60's style band and use my crescent on stage. it's light,it stays in tune and the action i set perfect and the neck is comfortable and fast. i love playing my other guitars,but this crescent is my workhorse. ya gotta buy one.
