this pedal is a tube screamer, or more correctly an exact replica. when mine came in the mail, i took it out of the box, plugged in my 300ma neg pin power supply, and immediately created a warm, old tube amp tone. i need to get a new, daisy chain chord, so i can use all my pedals at once, but i have no noise issues (those who do have ground loop issues). i also used a pen to push in the two pedal flap hinge pins to remove it and expose the battery compartment. anyone who removes the phillips screws to disassemble the pedal (removing the bottom) obviously has problems understanding directions. i will not, however, ever be using batteries.
