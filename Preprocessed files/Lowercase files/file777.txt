fun and easy to install. looks pretty cool too. not sure how long they'll hold up after i install the strings and start practicing bends. although they are thin, i still feel an slight edge when i run my fingers across them. we'll see,... kinda skeptical on how long these will last.
update. ok, so they didn't last that long. after a couple of months the top seal started peeling off, then the next layer started to peel. there was a bit of goop left over after removal which was a hassle to get off. 0000 grade steel wool took care of the frets and my guitar is back to being good as new. oh well, it still was a little fun.
