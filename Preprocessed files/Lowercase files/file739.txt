you know, for a low-cost item, these do a pretty good job.  we are using them for filler lights to keep shadows down on the stage. my friend has an earlier version that does not include the fans and he had issues with them flickering due to overheating.  with the fans added, although noisy, it seems to eliminate the flickering issue.

for the money, they are a good buy.
