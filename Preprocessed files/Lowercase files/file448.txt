this is now the second pop filter i have purchased of this brand, and there has been one significant upgrade that i am jealous that my previous purchase of item didn't have. i have been setting up two separate recording pc's at home, and my son wanted a similar setup as i had. the first filter i had purchased still works and i liked its ease of use. i was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing i disliked about mine had been changed.
it now has a branded logo or name on the face plastic surrounding the mesh screen. it's a little thing, but the simple addition of it makes for a cleaner item. i would have liked to have seen a different mounting solution for mounting it to a mic setup, as the current thumb screw is just a bit too short to mount to the boom arm spindle on which my mics shock mount attaches to. overall, this filter is serving its purpose well.
