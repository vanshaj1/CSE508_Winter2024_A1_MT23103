they came tarnished and discolored, i assume because they were clipped in during storage and shipping, see the pictures. they work with schallers so you don't have to worry about compatibility and i guess they'll be covered up when i'm playing out, so it's not really that big of a deal but i'm still kind of disappointed. they're also quite a bit bigger but i'm not sure if i hate this, obviously i'm used to smaller schallers however the larger washer means a more secure connection with my strap and more gold flair. i dunno, i'm still too disappointed with the discoloration.
