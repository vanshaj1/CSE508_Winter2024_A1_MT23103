the amazon advertised pictures of this item is a fender fte3 pre amp. the description says it's a fishman isys iii type. i googled it and found out there's two version of pre amp type of this t bucket 300 ce series. the one i got today is a fishman type pre amp which is for me much better that fte3. out of the box, i fell inlove with the color and design. mine is a 3 tone sunburst. the action is just right for me. the tone/sound is awesome. i hooked it up in my vox amp and i have to say this thing really rocks. of course you can get a better sounding acoustic/electric guitar out there for a very much expensive price. i'm a family man with two kids and i am not gonna spend a thousand bucks just for a hobby. amplified or not i love the tone of this baby. for it's appearance, sound quality, and of course the price, i'm giving it a five stars.

i uploaded some pictures (above) of the fishman pre amp version of this t bucket series. :o)..
