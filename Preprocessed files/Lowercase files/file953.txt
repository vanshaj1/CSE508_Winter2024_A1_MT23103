i needed something to put a karaoke monitor on out front of my dj setup and on a whim went looking around for a vesa mount for a mic stand. found one, but also found this, which is 10 times better! this stand is great! it is heavier duty than my speaker stands and the legs when fully opened will stabilize the biggest  monitor you reasonable would put on a vesa mount that size. the small 17" one i have on it solid. it is hard to tell in the photo but the mic holders do have a slot on the side so wired as well as wireless mikes can slip in, you'll want to use a round head shure 58 or equivalent so it doesn't fall through. like others have said the hardware is top notch, adjustments can be tightened down securely, and the monitor and its adapter can be taken off with just 2 thumb screws for transport. great deal at the 70 price too!
