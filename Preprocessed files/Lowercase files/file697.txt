just upgraded to this board and i am very happy i did. i needed more stereo inputs and this one had 4 of them. when it comes to an internet radio station you need a clean quiet board. i have no noise coming out of this board so i am very pleased. plus i needed the aux outs for my telosone set up. everything is working perfect!
