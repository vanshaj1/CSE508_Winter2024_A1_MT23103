this is very light yet very durable and protective. i have a squier strat and it fits perfectly. it won't fit the guitar with the strap on, but i never do that anyways. the pockets are big as well as the inside compartments. enough room for a few pedels inside or a strap, cord, picks and other small accessories.

very happy 

fyi, the guitar strap is a walker & williams. it was bought on here. highly recommend that too.
