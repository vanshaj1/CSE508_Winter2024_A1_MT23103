this was supposed to be red tortoise.  it's actually closer to brown tortoise.  maybe in between red and brown but certainly not what i consider red tortoise. i actually have another guitar in need of a brown tortoise cover so i'm using it on that one so not that big a deal, however will not work on my intended red tortoise guitar.  i've attached pic of the this cover which is on the guitar on the left.  the one on the right is what i consider a proper red tortoise.
