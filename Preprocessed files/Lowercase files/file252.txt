this pedal have been a good addition to my pedal board.  it did take some time to dial in the right mix and level.  i personally do not use the chorus and vibrato, but it does add a cool later to the sound.  the delay is very good and natural sounding.  this pedal is a great alternative to similar pedals that are much more expensive.

the pedal is in a solid metal housing.  the knobs are sturdy and have a good feel.  overall a great pedal for the price.
