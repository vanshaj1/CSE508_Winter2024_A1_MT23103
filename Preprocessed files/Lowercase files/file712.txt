for what it is, it is great. perfect for practice.  past my days of playing live, now it is just for pleasure.  this amp delivers for that.  keeps the noise down for others, delivers great sound, takes up almost zero space. great buy.

it comes with no instructions, so it takes some fooling around with it to learn all of its features.  basically, when you turn it on a green light is on, this is setting one. a quick push of the start button turns the light to yellow, this is setting two. another push turns the light red, this is setting three. if you turn on an effect  (one push is chorus, another push takes you to delay, one more push is reverb), the intensity of the effect is controlled by these settings (green the lowest amount of effect, red the highest). it also works on the distortion, pushing the sound from a classic rock distortion to an almost thrash metal distortion. for what it is, it is very versatile.
