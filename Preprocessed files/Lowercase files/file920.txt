i have a newer model build without the coveted lm308 chip so i can't comment or compare it to that but in certain settings it does sound great.  i don't use this as a primary distortion but rather as one of many and i frequently use it in tandem with my ds-1 or big muff pi. i use it to make already distorted sounds even louder and more dirty. the filter knob should not even have the option of going all the way clockwise. to me, it sounds like piss if you do that.
