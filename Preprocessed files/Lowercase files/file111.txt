i never knew this thing existed. i'm so glad i found this as i was always using a regular capo and placing it on just the 5 strings but the grip and placement was awkward and didn't provide a confident grip. using this allows good grip. i use this a lot to practice my finger-picking songs...gotta love that low e, open string, bass note. thank you planet waves for making this and in a simplistic yet convenient form.
