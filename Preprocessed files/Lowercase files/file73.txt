fits my squier stratocaster (bullet) great, with a few inches to spare lengthwise.  theres a ton of great zipper pockets, the handles are great and the padding is pretty decent. i use this for light traveling for my cheaper guitars. in my opinion i would not put an expensive guitar in here as the padding isn't the best, but it will still resist scratches and small bangs but more than likely not drops.
if you have an expensive fender or anything you cherish in your collection, id go for a strong solid case. this gig bag is mostly for around the house storage or for cheaper guitars that you wouldnt care too much if it dropped and got damaged.

overall im very happy with this guitar gig bag and will definitely order another one, plus the price is too hard to pass up on. perfect.
