absolutely awesome cables for the money. i've bought a number of these in different colors. the connectors are really decent and the cables are very well made- nice silicone jacket.  i've shortened a number of these lyxpro cables using the original ends for balanced line use in a patch bay.and also using, neutrix trs connectors, neutric xlr's, switchcraft right angle trs ends, and even some ends of off some seismic audio cables.
