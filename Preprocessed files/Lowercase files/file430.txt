i got these because i hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than i absolutely have to.... at first i thought i may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned, sounded better. played for another half hour and retuned, sounded even better. played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. will update after i get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... very impressed
