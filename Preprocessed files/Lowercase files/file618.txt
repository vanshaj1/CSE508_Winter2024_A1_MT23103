i purchased these stands to hold my yamaha hs5's. these stands are really well made..heavy and have a nice look to them. i really like the triangle base as it makes it easy for them to fit in the corners of my room. they have locking pins that are great for keeping the stands at the height that you set. they also have some type of rubber feet that helps with leveling the stand. these are pretty impressive. the only thing that i don't like is that the platform that the speakers sit on are a bit larger than i'd like...but this is more my fault for not reading the dimensions. other than that, i highly recommend these.
