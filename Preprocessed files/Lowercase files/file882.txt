very high quality pickguard material at a great price. i make thinline partscasters and like to change the control positions from the "stock" location so i have to manufacture my own pickguards.

short course:

make a template. i use 1/4" mdf. cut the pickguard blank a bit larger than the template. i use a scrollsaw with a spiral blade. mount the blank to the template using double sided turners tape and press together. i use barbell weights for pressure and wait an hour before routing. i use a 1/4" whiteside spiral flush trim bit on a router table to trim to size and a 45 degree bit to trim the edges at an angle. i use a plastic auto trim tool to separate the guard from the template. helpful hint: lightly sand the sharpened edge before you slash yourself.
