for a cheap, off-brand instrument, it plays excellently and resonates very well. the bass feels very sturdy and looks fantastic in person. it definitely needs better strings, but what new instrument doesn't? i haven't tried amplifying it, and i honestly don't plan to, as i only wanted it for the acoustic properties to practice without having to drape myself in cables. the neck is comfortable, the body is well-assembled, and having two strap buttons opposed to the usual single one on most acoustic basses is a welcome feature. the bridge is also very nice: the last acoustic i had, i kept losing bridge pins, so not having to deal with those was a main drawing point for this bass for me.
