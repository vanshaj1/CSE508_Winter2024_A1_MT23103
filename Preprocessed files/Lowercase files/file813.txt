i was invited to play quasi-dixieland banjo for a quasi-dixieland musical ("the boy friend").  they told me my banjo wasn't loud enough though i thought it was plenty loud. i didn't want to mess with a mike since the sound guys never get that right.  or with running a di into the sound board for the same reason.  so i ordered this pickup from amazon and installed it.  i ran it through a small crate combo amp (xt65r); it was plenty loud - in fact i'll be cutting it back tonight.  sound was ok, would probably be better through an "acoustic amp," but it's good enough for the musical.

won't go 5 stars until i get a chance to try it out in a better setting with better equipment. that said, i am very pleased with the value. i also uploaded two photographs that show the installation.
