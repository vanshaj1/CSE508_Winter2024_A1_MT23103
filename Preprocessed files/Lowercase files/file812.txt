so far i really love this tuner. nice, large brite screen, it's fully chromatic and your able to change the hz for non standard tunings, like a 432, which i have actually tune songs recorded in. one issue, don't forget to turn it off as apparently if you don't, it will not shut down on its own due to inactivity and will drain the battery to zero.
