just got this today and i was pleasantly surprised by the whole package!  well made case, legs and instrument.  this is my 2nd lap steel, my first was a recording king.  i'm as pleased if not more because my rk did not have the screw on legs and has a better case and was a bit cheaper.  i will buy another in the future!
