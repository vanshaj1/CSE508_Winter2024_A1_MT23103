great fixture

this fixture is amazing for the price! it feels solid and sturdy and of course quad leds! red green blue and white! the white is an amazing addition and gives a much more color spectrum available. you can finally get them warm white fades you want! this fixture is also perfect for uplighting, it has rubber feet on the bottom. the dmx and power in and out ports are on the sides of the back of the fixture which make it so you can lay the fixture flat on the ground without having to use the brackets. the is a very bright fixture with a wide beam angle. very blinding which is good. i do have 6 of these (by another company) and they are great for front lighting. it has a digital display for control. this fixture is awesome!
