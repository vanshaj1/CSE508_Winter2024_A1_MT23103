excellent, clear, punchy, great note definition. 60s rock, 70s r&b, modern jazz, this set covers it all. i build custom guitars and basses, have tried many different types and brands. these are my go to pickups. to be honest, i was a bit surprised at how articulate these are, as the sd quarter pound p-bass pickups are somewhat dark.
