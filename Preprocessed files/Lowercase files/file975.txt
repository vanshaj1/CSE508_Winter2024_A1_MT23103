i think the amount of positive feedback these mics are receiving should tell you something about how amazing they sound. i just simply want to say that if you purchase these mics, do yourself a huge favor and buy a 6" gooseneck! i use my spirits for drum overheads and apart from them sounding incredible, adding a little gooseneck makes this a perfect microphone. the internal shock absorption is actually really impressive! amazing mics for the money! grab you a couple!
