i would give this 2.5 stars. the reason they disappointed me somewhat is that the squares have a degree of variability to them. see my picture. some are taller than others, some are more grey others more black. and even after sitting a few days there were still dents in them. they worked but after buying 96 of these i wanted more uniformity.
