i received this and a innogear studio recording condenser microphone in exchange for an honest review, and i have to say as a podcaster and host of a radio show that i am able to do online this works amazing well.

i was familiar with products by innogear but now i have new respect for them because of this phantom power supply that allows you to do great things with the microphone, improving your sound in a big way.

the power supply is packaged nicely and travels well. i've take a few shots to allow you to see how easy it is to plug in your cable to the mic and get started without a lot of fuss.

totally worth the price and definitely something that podcasters and online radio show hosts can benefit from because of the quality.
