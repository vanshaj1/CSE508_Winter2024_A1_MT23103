was excited to get this case at a great price. it was very disappointing to receive the case and find that it would not close and latch completely right out of the box. the top and bottom case just don't seem to fit together right. seems to be bad quality control.

update: i received a return shipment label from amazon and shipped this back promptly and received confirmation from ups that it was delivered back to crossrock on 7/19/17. it's been a week (now 7/26/17) and crossrock still hasn't refunded and doesn't show that they received the package. so far not impressed with this company's service through amazon.

update: added a star back since they finally issued a refund.
