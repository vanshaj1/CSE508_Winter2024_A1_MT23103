stunned at how clear and full the audio was.  very easy to use with my iphone and a free audio recording app (voice record).  then just push the result up to dropbox.
i used it while giving a talk to a large family group using a ppt show. later combined the youmic recording with the powerpoint and only had to edit a few words here and there for content.  no eq or compression even necessary!
wish i had tried this a long time ago.
