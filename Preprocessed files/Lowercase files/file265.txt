as a "starter"" guitar or as a legit back-up it's hard to beat the lp-100 for the price.  i was a complete newb when i bought this model 5 months ago - took it to a friend who's been playing for 30 years and he was really impressed with everything about it.  as a result of having such a good time learning on this one i upgraded 3 weeks ago to an epiphone les paul standard red royale model.  i got the lp-100 back out last night for the heck of it and am still impressed with it. had thought about selling it when i got the new epi lp but i think now i will hold on to it awhile!!  i purchased black with cream colored trim then swapped out some of the trim for black and blue
