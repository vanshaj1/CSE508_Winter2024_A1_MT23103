cheap and effective. you'll need to print your own decals, but it's much less expensive than the 70 bucks some other fool was trying to get out of us. they look great! fits my shure mics nice and snug. will need to play with the sm57 a bit - not much room left to grab the mic with a foam screen. but we'll work through that.
