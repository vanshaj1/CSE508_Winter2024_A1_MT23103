this pedal works fine until it breaks, but they will break with any kind of moderate use.  the bottom portion is two pieces, and after a little time the plastic which connects the "pedal" to the "frame" breaks.  it's done it the same way in all of the ones i have.  i've been through about 4 of these in the last 3 years at my church, with two keyboard players using them each week on two separate instruments.  each of the two keyboards/sustain pedals get used once per week, for about 20 minutes.  i don't think this is enough use to break so consistently.  our work-around is something firm like a piece of floor tiling on the bottom and a whole lot of duct tape.

these on-stage pedals work great while they're working and always seem to be available for pick-up quickly from the music store for emergency use.  i'm just getting tired of seeing them.  i'm going to give roland a try next.  from the amazon images, they have what appears to be a solid piece of steel for the bottom plate?
