just hung up one of my strats. quickly mounted on the wall above my piano and it seems to be quite secure. i have some heavier guitars and for them i would probably use toggle bolts instead of the included screws and mollies but for most of my lighter weight fenders this is perfect.
i just ordered a second one to go over my bar, i a glad to have found this item.
