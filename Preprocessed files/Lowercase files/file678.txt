the mixer has good build. knobs, and sliders are smooth. buttons click with no crackling. it is quite.. no hiss. (unless turn pre-amps wide open). i'm not a big fan of rca jacks..but it is portable. best pick compared to other battery powered mixers imo. mixer is on top/left of pedalboard in the pics. i had to used rca right angle adapters so would fit in the pedalboard case.
